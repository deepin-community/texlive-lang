ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp (2.11-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency=high because this needs to get into Woody for the Chinese
    TrueType fonts to work properly.
  * Updated hintfiles to match the latest changes in x-ttcidfont-conf:
    - Changed "Width = Variable" to "Width = Fixed"
    - Added UniCharset
    - Removed "Transform = Boldize Slant"
  * Provides xfonts-arphic-* also.
  * Suggests x-ttcidfont-conf (>= 10) and Conflicts: x-ttcidfont-conf (<< 10).

  * No longer contains /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType

    and patch.  (Closes: Bug#107583)
  * Added "Transform = Boldize Slant" to the hintfile.

ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp (2.11-4) unstable; urgency=high   

  * Yikes!  Yet another bug in preinst!  bash returns false when the
    non-existent should_purge_xfonts is unset, whereas ash doesn't,
    and I only tested it with ash...  Hence, the ttf-arphic-* packages 
    became uninstallable for most users.  My apologies!
    Thanks to user "linux" of e-Fever BBS, Isaac To and Hon
    for notifying me of the problem.  Closes: Bug#100079.

ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp (2.11-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Oops!  In my zeal to remove /etc/X11/fonts/TrueType/xfonts-arphic-*
    files from the obsolete xfonts-arphic-* packages, I forgot to check
    whether /etc/X11/fonts/TrueType exists before cd'ing into it
    in preinst, often causing install to fail.  (I feel like putting
    a brown paper bag over my head, again.  :-)  Thanks to fellow developer
    Ryuichi Arafune for reporting this bug.  Re: Bug#99685.
  * Added reminders in package description and in postinst to tell
    the user to install "x-ttcidfont-conf" to use the fonts in X.
    Thanks to ha shao for the reminder!  Re: Bug#98868.
