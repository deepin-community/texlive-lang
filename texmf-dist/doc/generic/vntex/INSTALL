Installation
============

MikTeX
------
Official versions of VnTeX are provided by MikTeX.
Please use MikTeX's package manager to install or update VnTeX.

You only have to read on if you are going to install a beta release.
Beta releases are supposed for testing only but not for production.

The first line of this file contains the version number of the release
you downloaded.  You only have to follow the instructions below if it
contains the word "beta" and you really want to install it.

* Remove (if any) previous version of VnTeX by running
  [Programs]-->[MikTeX]-->[MikTeX Options], then select
  [Packages]-->[Language]-->[Vietnamese]-->[vntex].

* Unpack the vntex .zip file to some location, e.g., c:\texmf-vntex if
  you have installed MikTeX to c:\texmf.  If you have installed MikTeX
  to e.g c:\miktex\texmf, then it is recommended to unpack it in
  c:\miktex\texmf-vntex.

* Run [Programs]-->[MikTeX]-->[MikTeX Options], then select
  [Roots]-->[Add] and add c:\texmf-vntex (or c:\miktex\texmf-vntex).

* Refresh the file name database.

* If you want to use the T1 fonts that come with VnTeX, you also
  need to make dvips and pdftex aware of those fonts:

  Add the following lines to updmap.cfg:

    MixedMap vnrtext.map
    MixedMap vnrother.map
    Map urwvn.map
    Map chartervn.map
    Map mscorevn.map
    Map arevvn.map
    Map classicovn.map
    Map cmbrightvn.map
    Map comicvn.map
    Map concretevn.map
    Map garamondvn.map
    Map grotesqvn.map
    Map vntopia.map
    Map txttvn.map
    
  If there is an entry "MixedMap vnr.map", remove it.

* Run "initexmf -mkmaps".

* Edit the file MIKTEX.INI

  -- Add c:\windows\fonts to TTFPath.


TeX Live (UNIX, Linux, MacOS/X, Windows)
----------------------------------------

If you have TeX Live 2008 or later, run

   tlmgr install vntex

or

   tlmgr gui

if you prefer the graphical user interface.  On Windows you can invoke
the TeX Live Manager from the start menu.

Please consult the TeX Live documentation for more information.


teTeX, older versions of TeX Live (UNIX, Linux, MacOS/X, Windows)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

=====================================================================
If you have a version of TeX Live older than TeX Live 2008, keep in
mind that TeX Live for Windows behaves differently than TeX Live for
UNIX.  Please consult the TeX Live manual.
=====================================================================

In order to install VnTeX on a web2c system you have to unpack
vntex-3.2.2.zip inside of a texmf tree.  There are two ways to
install VnTeX:

1. If you want to test beta versions it is recommended that you create
   a separate directory for VnTeX so that you can remove old versions
   of VnTeX easily.  How to add a directory tree to the TEXMF search
   path is described in the manual of the TeX distribution you are
   using.

2. If you want to install an official release, it is recommended to
   put it into the texmf-local local directory.  In order to find out
   where it is, type

   	 kpsewhich --expand-var=\$TEXMFLOCAL (UNIX)
   	 kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMFLOCAL  (Windows)

   on the command line.  If you don't have root access you can either
   ask your system administrator to install VnTeX for you (this is
   preferred because other users might be interested as well).
   You alse can install it to your HOME directory.  To find out
   where it is, type

   	 kpsewhich --expand-var=\$TEXMFHOME (UNIX)
   	 kpsewhich --expand-var=$TEXMFHOME  (Windows)

   on the command line.  This directory might not exist and you have
   to create it manually.  If the output of kpsewhich looks
   reasonable, you can say:

         mkdir `kpsewhich --expand-var=\$TEXMFHOME` (UNIX only)

* Unpack the .zip file in TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME.

* Run texhash.

* Now you have to update the map files.

   This is a quite inconvenient task.  But there is a little Perl
   script in the same directory as the file you are just reading.
   It's called "vntex-update-maps".  If you type on the command
   line

	perl vntex-update-maps

   (without any arguments) you'll get a usage message.  If you say

	perl vntex-update-maps -help

   you'll get the same message but it will also tell you the content
   of the variables TEXMFHOME and TEXMFLOCAL.
   
   If you extracted the zip archive to TEXMFHOME you have to run 

      	perl vntex-update-maps -home

   and if you extracted it to TEXMFLOCAL you have to run

      	perl vntex-update-maps -sys

   If you supply the -n option, the commands that would be
   executed are printed to screen, but nothing is executed.

   Hence, if you want to create your own batch file, you can say:

        perl vntex-update-maps -sys -n > my_own_batchfile.bat

   This might be useful if you need a customized version of the
   script. 


TeX4ht (all systems)
--------------------
The Vietnamese fonts for tex4ht are now part of the tex4ht distribution.
In order to use TeX4ht you have to install the files needed by VnTeX.

Make sure your TeX4ht distribution is not too old.


plnfss (all systems)
--------------------
The plain TeX font selection macros are now a separate package.
You don't neeed it if you are using LaTeX or Context.

* Download from:

    http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/plain/plnfss

* Unpack the archive in the same texmf tree as VnTeX.

* Refresh the file database.
