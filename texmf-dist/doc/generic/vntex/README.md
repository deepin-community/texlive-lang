There is a mailing list (very low traffic) for questions about
VnTeX and typesetting Vietnamese.  To subscribe to the list, visit
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vntex/lists/vntex-users.

Nonfree Fonts
=============
VnTeX also provides Vietnamese support for URW Classico and URW
Garamond.  These fonts were released under the AFPL (Aladdin Free
Public License) and thus cannot be freely distributed.

TeX Live and MacTeX users can install them with getnonfreefonts,
see https://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/.

If your TeX distribution doesn't support getnonfreefonts you can
download https://ctan.org/tex-archive/install/fonts/vntex-nonfree.tds.zip. 
Please note that it's not sufficient to extract the zip file.

Font Samples
============
Samples of fonts provided by vntex and vntex-nonfree are available at
http://vntex.sourceforge.net/fonts/samples/.
