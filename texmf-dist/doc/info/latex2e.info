2 Overview of LaTeX
*******************

LaTeX is a system for typesetting documents.  It was originally created
by Leslie Lamport in 1984, but has been maintained by a group of
volunteers for many years now (<https://latex-project.org>).  It is
widely used, particularly but not exclusively for mathematical and
technical documents.

   A LaTeX user writes an input file containing text to be typeset along
with interspersed commands.  The default encoding for the text is UTF-8
(as of 2018).  The commands specify, for example, how the text should be
formatted.

   LaTeX is implemented as a set of so-called "macros" (a TeX “format”)
which use Donald E. Knuth's TeX typesetting program or one of its
derivatives, collectively known as "engines".  Thus, the user produces
output, typically PDF, by giving the input file to a TeX engine.  The
following sections describe all this in more detail.

   The term LaTeX is also sometimes used to mean the language in which
the input document is marked up, that is, to mean the set of commands
available to a LaTeX user.

   The name LaTeX is short for "Lamport TeX".  It is pronounced LAH-teck
or LAY-teck, or sometimes LAY-tecks.  Inside a document, produce the
logo with ‘\LaTeX’.  Where use of the logo is not sensible, such as in
plain text, write it as ‘LaTeX’.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Starting and ending,  Next: Output files,  Up: Overview

2.1 Starting and ending
=======================

LaTeX files have a simple global structure, with a standard beginning
and ending.  Here is a small example:

     \documentclass{article}
     \begin{document}
     Hello, \LaTeX\ world.
     \end{document}

Every LaTeX document has a ‘\begin{document}’ line and an
‘\end{document}’ line.

Here, the ‘article’ is the “document class”.  It is implemented in a
file ‘article.cls’.  You can use any document class available on your
system.  A few document classes are defined by LaTeX itself, and a vast
array of others are available.  *Note Document classes::.

   You can include other LaTeX commands between the ‘\documentclass’ and
the ‘\begin{document}’ commands.  This area is called the “preamble”.

   The ‘\begin{document}’ ... ‘\end{document}’ pair defines an
“environment”; the ‘document’ environment (and no others) is required in
all LaTeX documents (*note document::).  LaTeX provides many
environments that are documented here (*note Environments::).  Many more
are available to you from external packages, most importantly those
available at CTAN (*note CTAN::).

   The following sections discuss how to produce PDF or other output
from a LaTeX input file.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Output files,  Next: TeX engines,  Prev: Starting and ending,  Up: Overview

2.2 Output files
================

LaTeX produces a main output file and at least two auxiliary files.  The
main output file's name ends in either ‘.dvi’ or ‘.pdf’.

‘.dvi’
     If LaTeX is invoked with the system command ‘latex’ then it
     produces a DeVice Independent file, with extension ‘.dvi’.  You can
     view this file with a command such as ‘xdvi’, or convert it to a
     PostScript ‘.ps’ file with ‘dvips’ or to a Portable Document Format
     ‘.pdf’ file with ‘dvipdfmx’.  The contents of the file can be
     dumped in human-readable form with ‘dvitype’.  A vast array of
     other DVI utility programs are available
     (<https://mirror.ctan.org/dviware>).

‘.pdf’
     If LaTeX is invoked via the system command ‘pdflatex’, among other
     commands (*note TeX engines::), then the main output is a Portable
     Document Format (PDF) file.  Typically this is a self-contained
     file, with all fonts and images included.

   LaTeX always produces at least two additional files.

‘.log’
     This transcript file contains summary information such as a list of
     loaded packages.  It also includes diagnostic messages and perhaps
     additional information for any errors.

‘.aux’
     Auxiliary information is used by LaTeX for things such as cross
     references.  For example, the first time that LaTeX finds a forward
     reference--a cross reference to something that has not yet appeared
     in the source--it will appear in the output as a doubled question
     mark ‘??’.  When the referred-to spot does eventually appear in the
     source then LaTeX writes its location information to this ‘.aux’
     file.  On the next invocation, LaTeX reads the location information
     from this file and uses it to resolve the reference, replacing the
     double question mark with the remembered location.

   LaTeX may produce yet more files, characterized by the filename
ending.  These include a ‘.lof’ file that is used to make a list of
figures, a ‘.lot’ file used to make a list of tables, and a ‘.toc’ file
used to make a table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::).  A
particular class may create others; the list is open-ended.

2.3 TeX engines
===============

LaTeX is a large set of commands (macros) that is executed by a TeX
program (*note Overview::).  Such a set of commands is called a
“format”, and is embodied in a binary ‘.fmt’ file, which can be read
much more quickly than the corresponding TeX source.

   This section gives a terse overview of the TeX programs that are
commonly available (see also *note Command line interface::).

‘latex’
‘pdflatex’
     In TeX Live (<https://tug.org/texlive>), if LaTeX is invoked via
     either the system command ‘latex’ or ‘pdflatex’, then the pdfTeX
     engine is run (<https://ctan.org/pkg/pdftex>).  When invoked as
     ‘latex’, the main output is a ‘.dvi’ file; as ‘pdflatex’, the main
     output is a ‘.pdf’ file.

     pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX extensions to Knuth's original
     program (<https://ctan.org/pkg/etex>), including additional
     programming features and bi-directional typesetting, and has plenty
     of extensions of its own.  e-TeX is available on its own as the
     system command ‘etex’, but this is plain TeX (and produces ‘.dvi’).

     In other TeX distributions, ‘latex’ may invoke e-TeX rather than
     pdfTeX.  In any case, the e-TeX extensions can be assumed to be
     available in LaTeX, and a few extensions beyond e-TeX, particularly
     for file manipulation.

‘lualatex’
     If LaTeX is invoked via the system command ‘lualatex’, the LuaTeX
     engine is run (<https://ctan.org/pkg/luatex>).  This program allows
     code written in the scripting language Lua (<http://luatex.org>) to
     interact with TeX's typesetting.  LuaTeX handles UTF-8 Unicode
     input natively, can handle OpenType and TrueType fonts, and
     produces a ‘.pdf’ file by default.  There is also ‘dvilualatex’ to
     produce a ‘.dvi’ file.

‘xelatex’
     If LaTeX is invoked with the system command ‘xelatex’, the XeTeX
     engine is run (<https://tug.org/xetex>).  Like LuaTeX, XeTeX
     natively supports UTF-8 Unicode and TrueType and OpenType fonts,
     though the implementation is completely different, mainly using
     external libraries instead of internal code.  XeTeX produces a
     ‘.pdf’ file as output; it does not support DVI output.

     Internally, XeTeX creates an ‘.xdv’ file, a variant of DVI, and
     translates that to PDF using the (‘x’)‘dvipdfmx’ program, but this
     process is automatic.  The ‘.xdv’ file is only useful for
     debugging.

‘hilatex’
     If LaTeX is invoked via the system command ‘hilatex’, the HiTeX
     engine is run (<https://ctan.org/pkg/hitex>).  This program
     produces its own format, named HINT, designed especially for
     high-quality typesetting on mobile devices.

‘platex’
‘uplatex’
     These commands provide significant additional support for Japanese
     and other languages; the ‘u’ variant supports Unicode.  See
     <https://ctan.org/pkg/ptex> and <https://ctan.org/pkg/uptex>.

   As of 2019, there is a companion ‘-dev’ command and format for all of
the above, except ‘hitex’:

‘dvilualatex-dev’
‘latex-dev’
‘lualatex-dev’
‘pdflatex-dev’
‘platex-dev’
‘uplatex-dev’
‘xelatex-dev’
     These are candidates for an upcoming LaTeX release.  The main
     purpose is to find and address compatibility problems before an
     official release.

     These ‘-dev’ formats make it easy for anyone to help test documents
     and code: you can run, say, ‘pdflatex-dev’ instead of ‘pdflatex’,
     without changing anything else in your environment.  Indeed, it is
     easiest and most helpful to always run the ‘-dev’ versions instead
     of bothering to switch back and forth.  During quiet times after a
     release, the commands will be equivalent.

     These are not daily snapshots or untested development code.  They
     undergo the same extensive regression testing by the LaTeX team
     before being released.

     For more information, see "The LaTeX release workflow and the LaTeX
     ‘dev’ formats" by Frank Mittelbach, ‘TUGboat’ 40:2,
     <https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb40-2/tb125mitt-dev.pdf>.

2.4 Input text
==============

To a first approximation, most input characters in LaTeX print as
themselves.  But there are exceptions, as discussed in the following
sections.

* Menu:

* Input encodings::
* Ligatures::            Combined characters: ff fi fl ffi ffl " " - -- '! '?
* Special characters::   With special meaning: ‘\ { } % $ & _ ^ # ~’


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Input encodings,  Next: Ligatures,  Up: Input text

2.4.1 Input encodings
---------------------

The input to TeX (or any computer program) ultimately consists of a
sequence of bytes.  (Nowadays, a byte is almost universally an eight-bit
number, i.e., an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.)  The input
encoding defines how to interpret that sequence of bytes, and thus how
LaTeX behaves.

   Today, by far the most common way to encode text is with “UTF-8”, a
so-called "Unicode Transformation Format" which specifies how to
transform a sequence of 8-bit bytes to Unicode code points, which are
defined independent of any particular representation.  The Unicode
encoding defines code points for virtually all characters used today in
written text.

   When TeX was created, Unicode and UTF-8 did not exist and the 7-bit
ASCII encoding was by far the most widely used.  So TeX does not require
Unicode for text input.  UTF-8 is a superset of ASCII, so a pure 7-bit
ASCII document is also UTF-8.

   Since 2018, the default input encoding for LaTeX is UTF-8.  Some
methods for handling documents written in some other encoding, such as
ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), are explained in *note inputenc package::.

   You can easily find more about all these topics in any introductory
computer text or online.  For example, you might start at:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode>.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Ligatures,  Next: Special characters,  Prev: Input encodings,  Up: Input text

2.4.2 Ligatures
---------------

A “ligature” combines two or more letters (more generally, characters)
into a single glyph.  For example, in Latin-based typography, the two
letters ‘f’ and ‘i’ are often combined into the glyph 'fi'.

   TeX supports ligatures automatically.  To continue the example, if
the input has the word ‘fine’, written as four separate ASCII
characters, TeX will output the word 'fine' (with the default fonts),
with three typeset glyphs.

   In traditional TeX, the available ligatures, if any, are defined by
the current font.  TeX also uses the ligature mechanism to produce a few
typographical characters which were not available in any computer
encoding when TeX was invented.  In all, in the original Computer Modern
fonts, the following input character sequences are defined to lead to
ligatures:

‘ff’
     ff (ff ligature, U+FB00)
‘fi’
     fi (fi ligature, U+FB01)
‘fl’
     fl (fl ligature, U+FB02)
‘ffi’
     ffi (ffi ligature, U+FB03)
‘ffl’
     ffl (ffl ligature, U+FB04)
‘``’
     " (left double quotation mark, U+201C)
‘''’
     " (right double quotation mark, U+201D)
‘--’
     - (en-dash, U+2013)
‘---’
     -- (em-dash, U+2014)
‘!`’
     !'  (inverted exclamation mark, U+00A1)
‘?`’
     ?'  (inverted question mark, U+00BF)

(For the f-ligatures above, the text in parentheses shows the individual
characters, so in the typeset output you can easily see the difference
between the ligature and the original character sequence.)

   Nowadays it's usually possible to directly input the punctuation
characters as Unicode characters, and LaTeX supports that (see previous
section).  But even today, it can still often be useful to use the ASCII
ligature input form; for example, the difference between an en-dash and
em-dash, as a single glyph, can be all but impossible to discern, but
the difference between two and three ASCII hyphen characters is clear.
Similarly with quotation marks, in some fonts.

   Thus, even the engines with native support for UTF-8, namely LuaTeX
and XeTeX, also support the ASCII ligature input sequences by default,
independent of the font used.  They also need to do so for
compatibility.

   By the way, the f-ligatures are also available in Unicode (the
"Alphabetic Presentation Forms" block starting at U+FB00), but it's
almost never desirable to use them as input characters, since in
principle it should be up to the typesetter and the current font whether
to use ligatures.  Also, in practice, using them will typically cause
searches to fail, that is, a search for the two characters ‘fi’ will not
be matched by the ligature 'fi' at U+FB01.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Special characters,  Prev: Ligatures,  Up: Input text

2.4.3 Special characters: ‘\ { } % $ & _ ^ # ~’
-----------------------------------------------

Besides ligatures (see previous section), a few individual characters
have special meaning to LaTeX.  They are called “reserved characters” or
“special characters”.  Here they are:

‘\’
     Introduces a command name, as seen throughout this manual.

‘{’
‘}’
     Delimits a required argument to a command or a level of grouping,
     as seen throughout this manual.

‘%’
     Starts a comment: the ‘%’ and all remaining characters on the
     current line are ignored.

‘$’
     Starts and ends math mode (*note Math formulas::).

‘&’
     Separates cells in a table (*note tabular::).

‘_’
‘^’
     Introduce a subscript or superscript, respectively, in math (*note
     Subscripts & superscripts::); they produce an error outside math
     mode.  As a little-used special feature, two superscript characters
     in a row can introduce special notation for an arbitrary character.

‘#’
     Stands for arguments in a macro definition (*note \newcommand &
     \renewcommand::).

‘~’
     Produces a nonbreakable interword space (*note ~::).

   *Note Printing special characters::, for how to typeset these
characters when you need them literally.

2.5 LaTeX command syntax
========================

In the LaTeX input file, a command name starts with a backslash
character, ‘\’.  The name itself then consists of either (a) a string of
letters or (b) a single non-letter.

   LaTeX commands names are case sensitive; for example, ‘\pagebreak’
differs from ‘\Pagebreak’ (the latter is not a standard command).  Most
command names are lowercase, but in any event you must enter all
commands in the same case as they are defined.

   A command may be followed by zero, one, or more arguments.  These
arguments may be either required or optional.  Required arguments are
contained in curly braces, ‘{...}’.  Optional arguments are contained in
square brackets, ‘[...]’.  Generally, but not universally, if the
command accepts an optional argument, it comes first, before any
required arguments; optional arguments could come after required
arguments, or both before and after.

   Inside of an optional argument, to use the character close square
bracket (‘]’) hide it inside curly braces, as in ‘\item[closing bracket
{]}]’.  Similarly, if an optional argument comes last, with no required
argument after it, then to make the first character of the following
text be an open square bracket, hide it inside curly braces.

   LaTeX has the convention that some commands have a ‘*’ form that is
closely related to the form without a ‘*’, such as ‘\chapter’ and
‘\chapter*’.  The difference in behavior varies from command to command.

   This manual describes all accepted options and ‘*’-forms for the
commands it covers (barring unintentional omissions, a.k.a. bugs).

   As of the 2020-10-01 release of LaTeX, the ‘expl3’ and ‘xparse’
packages are part of the LaTeX2e format.  They provide a completely
different underlying programming language syntax.  We won't try to cover
that in this document; see the related package documentation and other
LaTeX manuals.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Environment syntax,  Next: \DocumentMetadata,  Prev: LaTeX command syntax,  Up: Overview

2.6 Environment syntax
======================

Synopsis:

     \begin{ENVIRONMENT-NAME}
       ...
     \end{ENVIRONMENT-NAME}

   An “environment” is an area of LaTeX source, inside of which there is
a distinct behavior.  For instance, for poetry in LaTeX put the lines
between ‘\begin{verse}’ and ‘\end{verse}’.

     \begin{verse}
       There once was a man from Nantucket \\
       ...
     \end{verse}

   *Note Environments::, for a list of environments.  Particularly
notable is that every LaTeX document must have a ‘document’ environment,
a ‘\begin{document} ... \end{document}’ pair.

   The ENVIRONMENT-NAME at the beginning must exactly match that at the
end.  This includes the case where ENVIRONMENT-NAME ends in a
star (‘*’); both the ‘\begin’ and ‘\end’ texts must include the star.

   Environments may have arguments, including optional arguments.  This
example produces a table.  The first argument is optional (and causes
the table to be aligned on its top row) while the second argument is
required (it specifies the formatting of columns).

     \begin{tabular}[t]{r|l}
       ... ROWS-OF-TABLE ...
     \end{tabular}

2.7 ‘\DocumentMetadata’: Producing tagged PDF output
====================================================

The ‘\DocumentMetadata’ command was added to LaTeX in 2022.  It enables
so-called "tagging" of the PDF output, aiding accessibility of the PDF.
It is supported best with LuaLaTeX; pdfLaTeX and XeLaTeX are supported
as well as possible (*note TeX engines::).

   It is unlike nearly any other command in LaTeX in that it must occur
before the ‘\documentclass’ command that starts a LaTeX document proper
(*note \documentclass::).  Therefore it must be called with
‘\RequirePackage’ rather than ‘\usepackage’ (*note \RequirePackage::).

   This support is still in development, so we will not try to list all
the possible settings.  Please see the ‘documentmetadata-support-doc’
document, part of the ‘latex-lab’ package
(<https://ctan.org/pkg/latex-lab>).  Here is a simple example which
enables most tagging currently implemented:

     \DocumentMetadata{testphase={phase-III,firstaid}}
     \documentclass{article}
     ...

   As you can see from the key name ‘testphase’, this is all still in an
experimental phase.  The LaTeX developers strongly encourage users to
give it a try and report problems, so it can be improved.

2.8 CTAN: The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
===============================================

The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network, CTAN, is the TeX and LaTeX
community's repository of free material.  It is a set of Internet sites
around the world that offer material related to LaTeX for download.
Visit CTAN on the web at <https://ctan.org>.

   This material is organized into packages, discrete bundles that
typically offer some coherent functionality and are maintained by one
person or a small number of people.  For instance, many publishers have
a package that allows authors to format papers to that publisher's
specifications.

   In addition to its massive holdings, the ‘ctan.org’ web site offers
features such as search by name or by functionality.

   CTAN is not a single host, but instead is a set of hosts, one of
which is the so-called "master".  The master host actively manages the
material, for instance, by accepting uploads of new or updated packages.
For many years, it has been hosted by the German TeX group, DANTE e.V.

   Other sites around the world help out by mirroring, that is,

3 Document classes
******************

The document's overall class is defined with the ‘\documentclass’
command, which is normally the first command in a LaTeX source file.

     \documentclass[OPTIONS]{CLASS}

   The following document CLASS names are built into LaTeX.  Many other
document classes are available as separate packages (*note Overview::).

‘article’
     For a journal article, a presentation, and miscellaneous general
     use.

‘book’
     Full-length books, including chapters and possibly including front
     matter, such as a preface, and back matter, such as an appendix
     (*note Front/back matter::).

‘letter’
     Mail, optionally including mailing labels (*note Letters::).

‘report’
     For documents of length between an ‘article’ and a ‘book’, such as
     technical reports or theses, which may contain several chapters.

‘slides’
     For slide presentations--rarely used nowadays.  The ‘beamer’
     package is perhaps the most prevalent replacement
     (<https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer>).  *Note beamer template::, for a
     small template for a beamer document.

   Standard OPTIONS are described in the next section.

* Menu:

3.1 Document class options
==========================

You can specify “global options” or “class options” to the
‘\documentclass’ command by enclosing them in square brackets.  To
specify more than one OPTION, separate them with a comma.

     \documentclass[OPTION1,OPTION2,...]{CLASS}

   LaTeX automatically passes options specified for ‘\documentclass’ on
to any other loaded classes that can handle them.

   Here is the list of the standard class options.

   All of the standard classes except ‘slides’ accept the following
options for selecting the typeface size; the default is ‘10pt’:

     10pt  11pt  12pt

   All of the standard classes accept these options for selecting the
paper size (dimensions are listed height by width):

‘a4paper’
     210 by 297mm (about 8.25 by 11.75 inches)

‘a5paper’
     148 by 210mm (about 5.8 by 8.3 inches)

‘b5paper’
     176 by 250mm (about 6.9 by 9.8 inches)

‘executivepaper’
     7.25 by 10.5 inches

‘legalpaper’
     8.5 by 14 inches

‘letterpaper’
     8.5 by 11 inches (the default)

   When using one of the engines pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX, or XeLaTeX (*note
TeX engines::), options other than ‘letterpaper’ set the print area but
you must also set the physical paper size.  Usually, the ‘geometry’
package is the best way to do that; it provides flexible ways of setting
the print area and physical page size.  Otherwise, setting the paper
size is engine-dependent.  For example, with pdfLaTeX, you could include
‘\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth’ and ‘\pdfpageheight=\paperheight’ in the
preamble.

   Miscellaneous other options:

‘draft’
‘final’
     Mark (‘draft’) or do not mark (‘final’) overfull boxes with a black
     box in the margin; default is ‘final’.

‘fleqn’
     Put displayed formulas flush left; default is centered.

‘landscape’
     Selects landscape format; default is portrait.

‘leqno’
     Put equation numbers on the left side of equations; default is the
     right side.

‘openbib’
     Use "open" bibliography format.

‘titlepage’
‘notitlepage’
     Specifies whether there is a separate page for the title
     information and for the abstract also, if there is one.  The
     default for the ‘report’ class is ‘titlepage’, for the other
     classes it is ‘notitlepage’.

   The following options are not available with the ‘slides’ class.

‘onecolumn’
‘twocolumn’
     Typeset in one or two columns; default is ‘onecolumn’.

‘oneside’
‘twoside’
     Selects one- or two-sided layout; default is ‘oneside’, except that
     in the ‘book’ class the default is ‘twoside’.

     For one-sided printing, the text is centered on the page.  For
     two-sided printing, the ‘\evensidemargin’ (‘\oddsidemargin’)
     parameter determines the distance on even (odd) numbered pages
     between the left side of the page and the text's left margin, with
     ‘\oddsidemargin’ being 40% of the difference between ‘\paperwidth’
     and ‘\textwidth’, and ‘\evensidemargin’ is the remainder.

‘openright’
‘openany’
     Determines if a chapter should start on a right-hand page; default
     is ‘openright’ for ‘book’, and ‘openany’ for ‘report’.

   The ‘slides’ class offers the option ‘clock’ for printing the time at
the bottom of each note.

3.2 ‘\usepackage’: Additional packages
======================================

To load a package PKG, with the package options given in the
comma-separated list OPTIONS:

     \usepackage[OPTIONS]{PKG}[MINDATE]

   To specify more than one package you can separate them with a comma,
as in ‘\usepackage{PKG1,PKG2,...}’, or use multiple ‘\usepackage’
commands.

   If the MINDATE optional argument is given, LaTeX gives a warning if
the loaded package has an earlier date, i.e., is too old.  The MINDATE
argument must be in the form ‘YYYY/MM/DD’.  More info on this:
<https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/47743>.

   ‘\usepackage’ must be used in the document preamble, between the
‘\documentclass’ declaration and the ‘\begin{document}’.  Occasionally
it is necessary to load packages before the ‘\documentclass’; see
‘\RequirePackage’ for that (*note \RequirePackage::).

   Any options given in the global ‘\documentclass’ command that are
unknown to the selected document class are passed on to the packages
loaded with ‘\usepackage’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Class and package creation,  Prev: \usepackage,  Up: Document classes

3.3 Class and package creation
==============================

You can create new document classes and new packages.  For instance, if
your memos must satisfy some local requirements, such as a standard
header for each page, then you could create a new class ‘smcmemo.cls’
and begin your documents with ‘\documentclass{smcmemo}’.

   What separates a package from a document class is that the commands
in a package are useful across classes while those in a document class
are specific to that class.  Thus, a command to set page headers is for
a package while a command to make the page headers be ‘Memo from the SMC
Math Department’ is for a class.

   Inside of a class or package definition you can use the at-sign ‘@’
as a character in command names without having to surround the code
containing that command with ‘\makeatletter’ and ‘\makeatother’ (*note
\makeatletter & \makeatother::).  This allows you to create commands
that users will not accidentally redefine.

   It is also highly desirable to prefix class- or package-specific
commands with your package name or similar string, to prevent your
definitions from clashing with those from other packages.  For instance,
the class ‘smcmemo’ might have commands ‘\smc@tolist’, ‘\smc@fromlist’,
etc.

* Class and package structure::     Layout of the file.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Class and package structure,  Up: Class and package creation

3.3.1 Class and package structure
---------------------------------

A class file or package file typically has four parts.

  1. In the “identification part”, the file says that it is a LaTeX
     package or class and describes itself, using the ‘\NeedsTeXFormat’
     and ‘\ProvidesClass’ or ‘\ProvidesPackage’ commands.

  2. The “preliminary declarations part” declares some commands and can
     also load other files.  Usually these commands will be those needed
     for the code used in the next part.  For example, an ‘smcmemo’
     class might be called with an option to read in a file with a list
     of people for the to-head, as ‘\documentclass[mathto]{smcmemo}’,
     and therefore needs to define a command
     ‘\newcommand{\setto}[1]{\def\@tolist{#1}}’ used in that file.

  3. In the “handle options part” the class or package declares and
     processes its options.  Class options allow a user to start their
     document as ‘\documentclass[OPTION LIST]{CLASS NAME}’, to modify
     the behavior of the class.  An example is when you declare
     ‘\documentclass[11pt]{article}’ to set the default document font
     size.

  4. Finally, in the “more declarations part” the class or package
     usually does most of its work: declaring new variables, commands
     and fonts, and loading other files.

   Here is a starting class file, which should be saved as ‘stub.cls’
where LaTeX can find it, for example in the same directory as the ‘.tex’
file.

     \NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
     \ProvidesClass{stub}[2017/07/06 stub to start building classes from]
     \DeclareOption*{\PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}}
     \ProcessOptions\relax
     \LoadClass{article}

It identifies itself, handles the class options via the default of
passing them all to the ‘article’ class, and then loads the ‘article’
class to provide the basis for this class's code.

   For more, see the official guide for class and package writers, the
Class Guide, at <https://ctan.org/pkg/clsguide> (much of the description
here derives from this document), or the tutorial at
<https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb26-3/tb84heff.pdf>.

specifically intended for class and package writers.

4 Fonts
*******

LaTeX comes with powerful font capacities.  For one thing, its New Font
Selection Scheme allows you to work easily with the font families in
your document (for instance, see *note Font styles::).  And, LaTeX
documents can use most fonts that are available today, including
versions of Times Roman, Helvetica, Courier, etc.  (Note, though, that
many fonts do not have support for mathematics.)

   The first typeface in the TeX world was the Computer Modern family,
developed by Donald Knuth.  It is the default for LaTeX documents and is
still the most widely used.  But changing to another font often only
involves a few commands.  For instance, putting the following in your
preamble gives you a Palatino-like font, which is handsome and more
readable online than many other fonts, while still allowing you to
typeset mathematics.  (This example is from Michael Sharpe,
<https://math.ucsd.edu/~msharpe/RcntFnts.pdf>.)

     \usepackage[osf]{newpxtext} % osf for text, not math
     \usepackage{cabin} % sans serif
     \usepackage[varqu,varl]{inconsolata} % sans serif typewriter
     \usepackage[bigdelims,vvarbb]{newpxmath} % bb from STIX
     \usepackage[cal=boondoxo]{mathalfa} % mathcal

In addition, the ‘xelatex’ or ‘lualatex’ engines allow you to use any
fonts on your system that are in OpenType or TrueType format (*note TeX
engines::).

   The LaTeX Font Catalogue (<https://tug.org/FontCatalogue>) shows font
sample graphics and copy-and-pasteable source to use many fonts,
including many with support for mathematics.  It aims to cover all Latin
alphabet free fonts available for easy use with LaTeX.

   More information is also available from the TeX Users Group, at
<https://www.tug.org/fonts/>.

4.1 ‘fontenc’ package
=====================

Synopsis:

     \usepackage[FONT_ENCODING]{fontenc}

   or

     \usepackage[FONT_ENCODING1, FONT_ENCODING2, ...]{fontenc}

   Specify the font encodings.  A font encoding is a mapping of the
character codes to the font glyphs that are used to typeset your output.

   This package only applies if you use the ‘pdflatex’ engine (*note TeX
engines::).  If you use the ‘xelatex’ or ‘lualatex’ engine then instead
use the ‘fontspec’ package.

   TeX's original font family, Computer Modern, has a limited character
set.  For instance, to make common accented characters you must use
‘\accent’ (*note \accent::) but this disables hyphenation.  TeX users
have agreed on a number of standards to access the larger sets of
characters provided by modern fonts.  If you are using ‘pdflatex’ then
put this in the preamble

     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

gives you support for the most widespread European languages, including
French, German, Italian, Polish, and others.  In particular, if you have
words with accented letters then LaTeX will hyphenate them and your
output can be copied and pasted.  (The optional second line allows you
to directly enter accented characters into your source file.)

   If you are using an encoding such as ‘T1’ and the characters appear
blurry or do not magnify well then your fonts may be bitmapped,
sometimes called raster or Type 3.  You want vector fonts.  Use a
package such as ‘lmodern’ or ‘cm-super’ to get a font that extends
LaTeX's default using vector fonts.

   For each FONT_ENCODING given as an option but not already declared,
this package loads the encoding definition files, named
‘FONT_ENCODINGenc.def’.  It also sets ‘\encodingdefault’ to be the last
encoding in the option list.

   These are the common values for FONT_ENCODING:

‘OT1’
     The original 7-bit encoding for TeX.  Limited to mostly English
     characters.

‘OMS, OML’
     Math symbols and math letters encoding.

‘T1’
     TeX text extended.  Sometimes called the Cork encoding for the
     users group meeting where it was developed (1990).  Gives access to
     most European accented characters.  The most common option for this
     package.

‘TS1’
     Text Companion encoding.

LaTeX's default is to load ‘OML’, ‘T1’, ‘OT1’, and then ‘OMS’, and set
the default to ‘OT1’.

   Even if you do not use accented letters, you may need to specify a
font encoding if your font requires it.

   If you use ‘T1’ encoded fonts other than the default Computer Modern
family then you may need to load the package that selects your fonts
before loading ‘fontenc’, to prevent the system from loading any
‘T1’ encoded fonts from the default.

   The LaTeX team reserves encoding names starting with: ‘T’ for the
standard text encodings with 256 characters, ‘TS’ for symbols that
extend the corresponding T encodings, ‘X’ for test encodings, ‘M’ for
standard math encodings with 256 characters, ‘A’ for special
applications, ‘OT’ for standard text encodings with 128 characters, and
‘OM’ for standard math encodings with 128 characters (‘O’ stands for
‘obsolete’).

   This package provides a number of commands, detailed below.  Many of
them are encoding-specific, so if you have defined a command that works
for one encoding but the current encoding is different then the command
is not in effect.

* Menu:

* \DeclareFontEncoding::          Define an encoding.
* \DeclareTextAccent::            Define an accent in the encoding.
* \DeclareTextAccentDefault::     Fallback for using an accent in the encoding.
* \DeclareTextCommand & \ProvideTextCommand::  New encoding-specific command.
* \DeclareTextCommandDefault & \ProvideTextCommandDefault::  Fallback for encoding-specific commands.
* \DeclareTextComposite::   Directly access an accented glyph, in the encoding.
* \DeclareTextCompositeCommand::    Run code in slot, in the encoding.
* \DeclareTextSymbol::              Define a symbol in the encoding.
* \DeclareTextSymbolDefault::       Fallback for a symbol in the encoding.
* \LastDeclaredEncoding::           Save most recently declared encoding.
* \UseTextSymbol & \UseTextAccent:: Temporarily switch to another encoding.

4.1.1 ‘\DeclareFontEncoding’
----------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareFontEncoding{ENCODING}{TEXT-SETTINGS}{MATH-SETTINGS}

   Declare the font encoding ENCODING.  It also saves the value of
ENCODING in ‘\LastDeclaredEncoding’ (*note \LastDeclaredEncoding::).

   The file ‘t1enc.def’ contains this line (followed by many others).

     \DeclareFontEncoding{T1}{}{}

   The TEXT-SETTINGS are the commands that LaTeX will run every time it
switches from one encoding to another with the ‘\selectfont’ and
‘\fontencoding’ commands.  The MATH-SETTINGS are the commands that LaTeX
will use whenever the font is accessed as a math alphabet.

   LaTeX ignores any space characters inside TEXT-SETTINGS and
MATH-SETTINGS, to prevent unintended spaces in the output.

   If you invent an encoding you should pick a two or three letter name
starting with ‘L’ for ‘local’, or ‘E’ for ‘experimental’.

   Note that output encoding files may be read several times by LaTeX so
using, e.g., ‘\newcommand’ may cause an error.  In addition, such files
should contain ‘\ProvidesFile’ line (*note Class and package
commands::).

   Note also that you should use the ‘\...Default’ commands only in a
package, not in the encoding definition files, since those files should
only contain declarations specific to that encoding.

4.1.2 ‘\DeclareTextAccent’
--------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextAccent{CMD}{ENCODING}{SLOT}

   Define an accent, to be put on top of other glyphs, in the encoding
ENCODING at the location SLOT.

   A “slot” is the number identifying a glyph within a font.

   This line from ‘t1enc.def’ declares that to make a circumflex accent
as in ‘\^A’, the system will put the accent in slot 2 over the ‘A’
character, which is represented in ASCII as 65.  (This holds unless
there is a relevant ‘DeclareTextComposite’ or
‘\DeclareTextCompositeCommand’ declaration; *note
\DeclareTextComposite::.)

     \DeclareTextAccent{\^}{T1}{2}

   If CMD has already been defined then ‘\DeclareTextAccent’ does not
give an error but it does log the redefinition in the transcript file.

4.1.3 ‘\DeclareTextAccentDefault’
---------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextAccentDefault{\CMD}{ENCODING}

   If there is an encoding-specific accent command \CMD but there is no
associated ‘\DeclareTextAccent’ for that encoding then this command will
pick up the slack, by saying to use it as described for ENCODING.

   For example, to make the encoding ‘OT1’ be the default encoding for
the accent ‘\"’, declare this.

     \DeclareTextAccentDefault{\"}{OT1}

If you issue a ‘\"’ when the current encoding does not have a definition
for that accent then LaTeX will use the definition from ‘OT1’

   That is, this command is equivalent to this call (*note
\UseTextSymbol & \UseTextAccent::).

     \DeclareTextCommandDefault[1]{\CMD}
        {\UseTextAccent{ENCODING}{\CMD}{#1}}

   Note that ‘\DeclareTextAccentDefault’ works for any one-argument
‘fontenc’ command, not just the accent command.

4.1.4 ‘\DeclareTextCommand’ & ‘\ProvideTextCommand’
---------------------------------------------------

Synopsis, one of:

     \DeclareTextCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}{DEFN}
     \DeclareTextCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \DeclareTextCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

   or one of:

     \ProvideTextCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}{DEFN}
     \ProvideTextCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \ProvideTextCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

   Define the command ‘\CMD’, which will be specific to one encoding.
The command name CMD must be preceded by a backslash, ‘\’.  These
commands can only appear in the preamble.  Redefining \CMD does not
cause an error.  The defined command will be robust even if the code in
DEFN is fragile (*note \protect::).

   For example, the file ‘t1enc.def’ contains this line.

     \DeclareTextCommand{\textperthousand}{T1}{\%\char 24 }

   With that, you can express parts per thousand.

     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}  % in preamble
       ...
     Legal limit is \( 0.8 \)\textperthousand.

If you change the font encoding to ‘OT1’ then you get an error like
‘LaTeX Error: Command \textperthousand unavailable in encoding OT1’.

   The ‘\ProvideTextCommand’ variant does the same, except that it does
nothing if ‘\CMD’ is already defined.  The ‘\DeclareTextSymbol’ command
is faster than this one for simple slot-to-glyph association (*note
\DeclareTextSymbol::)

   The optional NARGS and OPTARGDEFAULT arguments play the same role
here as in ‘\newcommand’ (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::).
Briefly, NARGS is an integer from 0 to 9 specifying the number of
arguments that the defined command ‘\CMD’ takes.  This number includes
any optional argument.  Omitting this argument is the same as specifying
0, meaning that ‘\CMD’ will have no arguments.  And, if OPTARGDEFAULT is
present then the first argument of ‘\CMD’ is optional, with default
value OPTARGDEFAULT (which may be the empty string).  If OPTARGDEFAULT
is not present then ‘\CMD’ does not take an optional argument.

4.1.5 ‘\DeclareTextCommandDefault’ & ‘\ProvideTextCommandDefault ’
------------------------------------------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextCommandDefault{\CMD}{DEFN}

   or:

     \ProvideTextCommandDefault{\CMD}{DEFN}

   Give a default definition for ‘\CMD’, for when that command is not
defined in the encoding currently in force.  This default should only
use encodings known to be available.

   This makes ‘\copyright’ available.

     \DeclareTextCommandDefault{\copyright}{\textcircled{c}}

It uses only an encoding (OMS) that is always available.

   The ‘\DeclareTextCommandDefault’ should not occur in the encoding
definition files since those files should declare only commands for use
when you select that encoding.  It should instead be in a package.

   As with the related non-default commands, the
‘\ProvideTextCommandDefault’ has exactly the same behavior as
‘\DeclareTextCommandDefault’ except that it does nothing if ‘\CMD’ is
already defined (*note \DeclareTextCommand & \ProvideTextCommand::).
So, packages can use it to provide fallbacks that other packages can
improve upon.

4.1.6 ‘\DeclareTextComposite’
-----------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextComposite{\CMD}{ENCODING}{SIMPLE_OBJECT}{SLOT}

   Access an accented glyph directly, that is, without having to put an
accent over a separate character.

   This line from ‘t1enc.def’ means that ‘\^o’ will cause LaTeX to
typeset lowercase ‘o’ by taking the character directly from slot 224 in
the font.

     \DeclareTextComposite{\^}{T1}{o}{244}

   *Note fontenc package::, for a list of common encodings.  The
SIMPLE_OBJECT should be a single character or a single command.  The
SLOT argument is usually a positive integer represented in decimal
(although octal or hexadecimal are possible).  Normally \CMD has already
been declared for this encoding, either with ‘\DeclareTextAccent’ or
with a one-argument ‘\DeclareTextCommand’.  In ‘t1enc.def’, the above
line follows the ‘\DeclareTextAccent{\^}{T1}{2}’ command.

4.1.7 ‘\DeclareTextCompositeCommand’
------------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\CMD}{ENCODING}{ARG}{CODE}

   A more general version of ‘\DeclareTextComposite’ that runs arbitrary
code with ‘\CMD’.

   This allows accents on ‘i’ to act like accents on dotless i, ‘\i’.

     \DeclareTextCompositeCommand{\'}{OT1}{i}{\'\i}

   *Note fontenc package::, for a list of common encodings.  Normally
‘\CMD’ will have already been declared with ‘\DeclareTextAccent’ or as a
one argument ‘\DeclareTextCommand’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \DeclareTextSymbol,  Next: \DeclareTextSymbolDefault,  Prev: \DeclareTextCompositeCommand,  Up: fontenc package

4.1.8 ‘\DeclareTextSymbol’
--------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextSymbol{\CMD}{ENCODING}{SLOT}

   Define a symbol in the encoding ENCODING at the location SLOT.
Symbols defined in this way are for use in text, not mathematics.

   For example, this line from ‘t1enc.def’ declares the number of the
glyph to use for «, the left guillemet.

     \DeclareTextSymbol{\guillemetleft}{T1}{19}

The command ‘\DeclareTextCommand{\guillemetleft}{T1}{\char 19}’ has the
same effect but is slower (*note \DeclareTextCommand &
\ProvideTextCommand::).

   *Note fontenc package::, for a list of common encodings.  The SLOT
can be specified in decimal, or octal (as in ‘'023’), or hexadecimal (as
in ‘"13’), although decimal has the advantage that single quote or
double quote could be redefined by another package.

   If ‘\CMD’ has already been defined then ‘\DeclareTextSymbol’ does not
give an error but it does log the redefinition in the transcript file.

4.1.9 ‘\DeclareTextSymbolDefault’
---------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareTextSymbolDefault{\CMD}{ENCODING}

   If there is an encoding-specific symbol command ‘\CMD’ but there is
no associated ‘\DeclareTextSymbol’ for that encoding, then this command
will pick up the slack, by saying to get the symbol as described for
ENCODING.

   For example, to declare that if the current encoding has no meaning
for ‘\textdollar’ then use the one from ‘OT1’, declare this.

     \DeclareTextSymbolDefault{\textdollar}{OT1}

   That is, this command is equivalent to this call (*note
\UseTextSymbol & \UseTextAccent::).

     \DeclareTextCommandDefault{\CMD}
        {\UseTextSymbol{ENCODING}{\CMD}}

   Note that ‘\DeclareTextSymbolDefault’ can be used to define a default
for any zero-argument ‘fontenc’ command.

   Get the name of the most recently declared encoding.  The
‘\DeclareFontEncoding’ command stores the name so that it can be
retrieved with this command (*note \DeclareFontEncoding::).

   This relies on ‘\LastDeclaredEncoding’ rather than give the name of
the encoding explicitly.

     \DeclareFontEncoding{JH1}{}{}
     \DeclareTextAccent{\'}{\LastDeclaredEncoding}{0}

4.1.11 ‘\UseTextSymbol’ & ‘\UseTextAccent’
------------------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \UseTextSymbol{ENCODING}{\CMD}

   or:

     \UseTextAccent{ENCODING}{\CMD}{TEXT}

   Use a symbol or accent not from the current encoding.

   In general, to use a ‘fontenc’ command in an encoding where it is not
defined, and if the command has no arguments, then you can use it like
this:

     \UseTextSymbol{OT1}{\ss}

which is equivalent to this (note the outer braces form a group, so
LaTeX reverts back to the prior encoding after the ‘\ss’):

     {\fontencoding{OT1}\selectfont\ss}

   Similarly, to use a ‘fontenc’ command in an encoding where it is not
defined, and if the command has one argument, you can use it like this:

     \UseTextAccent{OT1}{\'}{a}

which is equivalent to this (again note the outer braces forming a
group):

     {fontencoding{OT1}\selectfont\'{\fontencoding{ENC_IN_USE}\selectfont a}}

Here, ENC_IN_USE is the encoding in force before this sequence of
commands, so that ‘a’ is typeset using the current encoding and only the
accent is taken from ‘OT1’.

4.2 Font styles
===============

The following type style commands are supported by LaTeX.

   In the table below the listed commands, the ‘\text...’ commands, are
used with an argument as in ‘\textit{TEXT}’.  This is the preferred
form.  But shown after it in parenthesis is the corresponding
“declaration form”, which is often useful.  This form takes no
arguments, as in ‘{\itshape TEXT}’.  The scope of the declaration form
lasts until the next type style command or the end of the current group.
In addition, each has an environment form such as
‘\begin{itshape}...\end{itshape}’, which we'll describe further at the
end of the section.

   These commands, in any of the three forms, are cumulative; for
instance you can get bold sans serif by saying either of
‘\sffamily\bfseries’ or ‘\bfseries\sffamily’.

   One advantage of these commands is that they automatically insert
italic corrections if needed (*note \/::).  Specifically, they insert
the italic correction unless the following character is in the list
‘\nocorrlist’, which by default consists of period and comma.  To
suppress the automatic insertion of italic correction, use ‘\nocorr’ at
the start or end of the command argument, such as ‘\textit{\nocorr
text}’ or ‘\textsc{text \nocorr}’.

‘\textrm (\rmfamily)’
     Roman.

‘\textit (\itshape)’
     Italics.

‘\textmd (\mdseries)’
     Medium weight (default).

‘\textbf (\bfseries)’
     Boldface.

‘\textup (\upshape)’
     Upright (default).

‘\textsl (\slshape)’
     Slanted.

‘\textsf (\sffamily)’
     Sans serif.

‘\textsc (\scshape)’
     Small caps.

‘\texttt (\ttfamily)’
     Typewriter.

‘\textnormal (\normalfont)’
     Main document font.

   Although it also changes fonts, the ‘\emph{TEXT}’ command is
semantic, for TEXT to be emphasized, and should not be used as a
substitute for ‘\textit’.  For example, ‘\emph{START TEXT \emph{MIDDLE
TEXT} END TEXT}’ will result in the START TEXT and END TEXT in italics,
but MIDDLE TEXT will be in roman.

   LaTeX also provides the following commands, which unconditionally
switch to the given style, that is, are _not_ cumulative.  They are used
as declarations: ‘{\CMD...}’ instead of ‘\CMD{...}’.

   (The unconditional commands below are an older version of font
switching.  The earlier commands are an improvement in most
circumstances.  But sometimes an unconditional font switch is what is
needed.)

‘\bf’
     Switch to bold face.

‘\cal’
     Switch to calligraphic letters for math.

‘\it’
     Italics.

‘\rm’
     Roman.

‘\sc’
     Small caps.

‘\sf’
     Sans serif.

‘\sl’
     Slanted (oblique).

‘\tt’
     Typewriter (monospace, fixed-width).

   The ‘\em’ command is the unconditional version of ‘\emph’.

   The following commands are for use in math mode.  They are not
cumulative, so ‘\mathbf{\mathit{SYMBOL}}’ does not create a boldface and
italic SYMBOL; instead, it will just be in italics.  This is because
typically math symbols need consistent typographic treatment, regardless
of the surrounding environment.

‘\mathrm’
     Roman, for use in math mode.

‘\mathbf’
     Boldface, for use in math mode.

‘\mathsf’
     Sans serif, for use in math mode.

‘\mathtt’
     Typewriter, for use in math mode.

‘\mathit’
‘(\mit)’
     Italics, for use in math mode.

‘\mathnormal’
     For use in math mode, e.g., inside another type style declaration.

‘\mathcal’
     Calligraphic letters, for use in math mode.

   In addition, the command ‘\mathversion{bold}’ can be used for
switching to bold letters and symbols in formulas.
‘\mathversion{normal}’ restores the default.

   Finally, the command ‘\oldstylenums{NUMERALS}’ will typeset so-called
"old-style" numerals, which have differing heights and depths (and
sometimes widths) from the standard "lining" numerals, which all have
the same height as uppercase letters.  LaTeX's default fonts support
this, and will respect ‘\textbf’ (but not other styles; there are no
italic old-style numerals in Computer Modern).  Many other fonts have
old-style numerals also; sometimes package options are provided to make
them the default.  FAQ entry: <https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-osf>.

4.3 Font sizes
==============

The following standard type size commands are supported by LaTeX.  The
table shows the command name and the corresponding actual font size used
(in points) with the ‘10pt’, ‘11pt’, and ‘12pt’ document size options,
respectively (*note Document class options::).

Command                     ‘10pt’    ‘11pt’    ‘12pt’
--------------------------------------------------------
‘\tiny’                     5         6         6
‘\scriptsize’               7         8         8
‘\footnotesize’             8         9         10
‘\small’                    9         10        10.95
‘\normalsize’ (default)     10        10.95     12
‘\large’                    12        12        14.4
‘\Large’                    14.4      14.4      17.28
‘\LARGE’                    17.28     17.28     20.74
‘\huge’                     20.74     20.74     24.88
‘\Huge’                     24.88     24.88     24.88

   The commands are listed here in declaration (not environment) form,
since that is how they are typically used.  For example.

     \begin{quotation} \small
       The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao.
     \end{quotation}

Here, the scope of the ‘\small’ lasts until the end of the ‘quotation’
environment.  It would also end at the next type style command or the
end of the current group, so you could enclose it in curly braces
‘{\small This text is typeset in the small font.}’.

   Trying to use these commands in math, as with ‘$\small mv^2/2$’,
results in ‘LaTeX Font Warning: Command \small invalid in math mode’,
and the font size doesn't change.  To work with a too-large formula,
often the best option is to use the ‘displaymath’ environment (*note
Math formulas::), or one of the environments from the ‘amsmath’ package.
For inline mathematics, such as in a table of formulas, an alternative
is something like ‘{\small $mv^2/2$}’.  (Sometimes ‘\scriptsize’ and
‘\scriptstyle’ are confused.  Both change the font size, but the latter
also changes a number of other aspects of how mathematics is typeset.
*Note Math styles::.)

   An “environment form” of each of these commands is also defined; for
instance, ‘\begin{tiny}...\end{tiny}’.  However, in practice this form
can easily lead to unwanted spaces at the beginning and/or end of the
environment without careful consideration, so it's generally less
error-prone to stick to the declaration form.

   (Aside: Technically, due to the way LaTeX defines ‘\begin’ and
‘\end’, nearly every command that does not take an argument technically
has an environment form.  But in almost all cases, it would only cause
confusion to use it.  The reason for mentioning the environment form of
the font size declarations specifically is that this particular use is
not rare.)

4.4 Low-level font commands
===========================

These commands are primarily intended for writers of macros and
packages.  The commands listed here are only a subset of the available
ones.

‘\fontencoding{ENCODING}’
     Select the font encoding, the encoding of the output font.  There
     are a large number of valid encodings.  The most common are ‘OT1’,
     Knuth's original encoding for Computer Modern (the default), and
     ‘T1’, also known as the Cork encoding, which has support for the
     accented characters used by the most widespread European languages
     (German, French, Italian, Polish and others), which allows TeX to
     hyphenate words containing accented letters.  For more, see
     <https://ctan.org/pkg/encguide>.

‘\fontfamily{FAMILY}’
     Select the font family.  The web page
     <https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/> provides one way to browse through
     many of the fonts easily used with LaTeX.  Here are examples of
     some common families.

     ‘pag’  Avant Garde
     ‘fvs’  Bitstream Vera Sans
     ‘pbk’  Bookman
     ‘bch’  Charter
     ‘ccr’  Computer Concrete
     ‘cmr’  Computer Modern
     ‘cmss’ Computer Modern Sans Serif
     ‘cmtt’ Computer Modern Typewriter
     ‘pcr’  Courier
     ‘phv’  Helvetica
     ‘fi4’  Inconsolata
     ‘lmr’  Latin Modern
     ‘lmss’ Latin Modern Sans
     ‘lmtt’ Latin Modern Typewriter
     ‘pnc’  New Century Schoolbook
     ‘ppl’  Palatino
     ‘ptm’  Times
     ‘uncl’ Uncial
     ‘put’  Utopia
     ‘pzc’  Zapf Chancery

‘\fontseries{SERIES}’
     Select the font series.  A “series” combines a “weight” and a
     “width”.  Typically, a font supports only a few of the possible
     combinations.  Some common combined series values include:

     ‘m’  Medium (normal)
     ‘b’  Bold
     ‘c’  Condensed
     ‘bc’ Bold condensed
     ‘bx’ Bold extended

     The possible values for weight, individually, are:

     ‘ul’ Ultra light
     ‘el’ Extra light
     ‘l’  Light
     ‘sl’ Semi light
     ‘m’  Medium (normal)
     ‘sb’ Semi bold
     ‘b’  Bold
     ‘eb’ Extra bold
     ‘ub’ Ultra bold

     The possible values for width, individually, are (the meaning and
     relationship of these terms varies with individual typefaces):

     ‘uc’ Ultra condensed
     ‘ec’ Extra condensed
     ‘c’  Condensed
     ‘sc’ Semi condensed
     ‘m’  Medium
     ‘sx’ Semi expanded
     ‘x’  Expanded
     ‘ex’ Extra expanded
     ‘ux’ Ultra expanded

     When forming the SERIES string from the weight and width, drop the
     ‘m’ that stands for medium weight or medium width, unless both
     weight and width are ‘m’, in which case use just one (‘‘m’’).

‘\fontshape{SHAPE}’
     Select font shape.  Valid shapes are:

     ‘n’  Upright (normal)
     ‘it’ Italic
     ‘sl’ Slanted (oblique)
     ‘sc’ Small caps
     ‘ui’ Upright italics
     ‘ol’ Outline

     The two last shapes are not available for most font families, and
     small caps are often missing as well.

‘\fontsize{SIZE}{SKIP}’
     Set the font size and the line spacing.  The unit of both
     parameters defaults to points (‘pt’).  The line spacing is the
     nominal vertical space between lines, baseline to baseline.  It is
     stored in the parameter ‘\baselineskip’.  The default
     ‘\baselineskip’ for the Computer Modern typeface is 1.2 times the
     ‘\fontsize’.  Changing ‘\baselineskip’ directly is inadvisable
     since its value is reset every time a size change happens; instead
     use ‘\baselinestretch’.  (*note \baselineskip &
     \baselinestretch::).

‘\linespread{FACTOR}’
     Equivalent to ‘\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{FACTOR}’, and
     therefore must be followed by ‘\selectfont’ to have any effect.
     Best specified in the preamble.  *Note \baselineskip &
     \baselinestretch::, for using ‘setspace’ package instead.

‘\selectfont’
     The effects of the font commands described above do not happen
     until ‘\selectfont’ is called, as in
     ‘\fontfamily{FAMILYNAME}\selectfont’.  It is often useful to put
     this in a macro:
     ‘\newcommand*{\myfont}{\fontfamily{FAMILYNAME}\selectfont}’
     (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::).

‘\usefont{ENC}{FAMILY}{SERIES}{SHAPE}’
     The same as invoking ‘\fontencoding’, ‘\fontfamily’, ‘\fontseries’
     and ‘\fontshape’ with the given parameters, followed by
     ‘\selectfont’.  For example:

          \usefont{ot1}{cmr}{m}{n}

5.1 ‘\onecolumn’
================

Synopsis:

     \onecolumn

   Start a new page and produce single-column output.  If the document
is given the class option ‘onecolumn’ then this is the default behavior
(*note Document class options::).  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \twocolumn,  Next: \flushbottom,  Prev: \onecolumn,  Up: Layout

5.2 ‘\twocolumn’
================

Synopses:

     \twocolumn
     \twocolumn[PRELIM ONE COLUMN TEXT]

   Start a new page and produce two-column output.  If the document is
given the class option ‘twocolumn’ then this is the default (*note
Document class options::).  This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   If the optional PRELIM ONE COLUMN TEXT argument is present, it is
typeset in one-column mode before the two-column typesetting starts.

   These parameters control typesetting in two-column output:

‘\columnsep’
     The distance between columns.  The default is 35pt.  Change it with
     a command such as ‘\setlength{\columnsep}{40pt}’.  You must change
     it before the two column mode starts; in the preamble is a good
     place.

‘\columnseprule’
     The width of the rule between columns.  The default is 0pt, meaning
     that there is no rule.  Otherwise, the rule appears halfway between
     the two columns.  Change it with a command such as
     ‘\setlength{\columnseprule}{0.4pt}’, before the two-column mode
     starts.

‘\columnwidth’
     The width of a single column.  In one-column mode this is equal to
     ‘\textwidth’.  In two-column mode by default LaTeX sets the width
     of each of the two columns, ‘\columnwidth’, to be half of
     ‘\textwidth’ minus ‘\columnsep’.

   In a two-column document, the starred environments ‘table*’ and
‘figure*’ are two columns wide, whereas the unstarred environments
‘table’ and ‘figure’ take up only one column (*note figure:: and *note
table::).  LaTeX places starred floats at the top of a page.  The
following parameters control float behavior of two-column output.

‘\dbltopfraction’
     The maximum fraction at the top of a two-column page that may be
     occupied by two-column wide floats.  The default is 0.7, meaning
     that the height of a ‘table*’ or ‘figure*’ environment must not
     exceed ‘0.7\textheight’.  If the height of your starred float
     environment exceeds this then you can take one of the following
     actions to prevent it from floating all the way to the back of the
     document:

        • Use the ‘[tp]’ location specifier to tell LaTeX to try to put
          the bulky float on a page by itself, as well as at the top of
          a page.

        • Use the ‘[t!]’ location specifier to override the effect of
          ‘\dbltopfraction’ for this particular float.

        • Increase the value of ‘\dbltopfraction’ to a suitably large
          number, to avoid going to float pages so soon.

     You can redefine it, as with ‘\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}’.

‘\dblfloatpagefraction’
     For a float page of two-column wide floats, this is the minimum
     fraction that must be occupied by floats, limiting the amount of
     blank space.  LaTeX's default is ‘0.5’.  Change it with
     ‘\renewcommand’.

‘\dblfloatsep’
     On a float page of two-column wide floats, this length is the
     distance between floats, at both the top and bottom of the page.
     The default is ‘12pt plus2pt minus2pt’ for a document set at ‘10pt’
     or ‘11pt’, and ‘14pt plus2pt minus4pt’ for a document set at
     ‘12pt’.

‘\dbltextfloatsep’
     This length is the distance between a multi-column float at the top
     or bottom of a page and the main text.  The default is ‘20pt
     plus2pt minus4pt’.

‘\dbltopnumber’
     On a float page of two-column wide floats, this counter gives the
     maximum number of floats allowed at the top of the page.  The LaTeX
     default is ‘2’.

   This example uses ‘\twocolumn’'s optional argument of to create a
title that spans the two-column article:

     \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
     \newcommand{\authormark}[1]{\textsuperscript{#1}}
     \begin{document}
     \twocolumn[{% inside this optional argument goes one-column text
       \centering
       \LARGE The Title \\[1.5em]
       \large Author One\authormark{1},
              Author Two\authormark{2},
              Author Three\authormark{1} \\[1em]
       \normalsize
       \begin{tabular}{p{.2\textwidth}@{\hspace{2em}}p{.2\textwidth}}
         \authormark{1}Department one  &\authormark{2}Department two \\
          School one                   &School two
       \end{tabular}\\[3em] % space below title part
       }]

File: latex2e.info,  Node: \flushbottom,  Next: \raggedbottom,  Prev: \twocolumn,  Up: Layout

5.3 ‘\flushbottom’
==================

Make all pages in the document after this declaration have the same
height, by stretching the vertical space where necessary to fill out the
page.  This is most often used when making two-sided documents since the
differences in facing pages can be glaring.

   If TeX cannot satisfactorily stretch the vertical space in a page
then you get a message like ‘Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has
occurred while \output is active’.  If you get that, one option is to
change to ‘\raggedbottom’ (*note \raggedbottom::).  Alternatively, you
can adjust the ‘textheight’ to make compatible pages, or you can add
some vertical stretch glue between lines or between paragraphs, as in
‘\setlength{\parskip}{0ex plus0.1ex}’.  Your last option is to, in a
final editing stage, adjust the height of individual pages (*note
\enlargethispage::).

   The ‘\flushbottom’ state is the default only if you select the
‘twocolumn’ document class option (*note Document class options::), and
for indexes made using ‘makeidx’.

5.4 ‘\raggedbottom’
===================

Make all later pages the natural height of the material on that page; no
rubber vertical lengths will be stretched.  Thus, in a two-sided
document the facing pages may be different heights.  This command can go
at any point in the document body.  *Note \flushbottom::.

   This is the default unless you select the ‘twocolumn’ document class
option (*note Document class options::).

5.5 Page layout parameters
==========================

‘\columnsep’
‘\columnseprule’
‘\columnwidth’
     The distance between the two columns, the width of a rule between
     the columns, and the width of the columns, when the document class
     option ‘twocolumn’ is in effect (*note Document class options::).
     *Note \twocolumn::.

‘\headheight’
     Height of the box that contains the running head.  The default in
     the ‘article’, ‘report’, and ‘book’ classes is ‘12pt’, at all type
     sizes.

‘\headsep’
     Vertical distance between the bottom of the header line and the top
     of the main text.  The default in the ‘article’ and ‘report’
     classes is ‘25pt’.  In the ‘book’ class the default is: if the
     document is set at 10pt then it is ‘0.25in’, and at 11pt or 12pt it
     is ‘0.275in’.

‘\footskip’
     Distance from the baseline of the last line of text to the baseline
     of the page footer.  The default in the ‘article’ and ‘report’
     classes is ‘30pt’.  In the ‘book’ class the default is: when the
     type size is 10pt the default is ‘0.35in’, while at 11pt it is
     ‘0.38in’, and at 12pt it is ‘30pt’.

‘\linewidth’
     Width of the current line, decreased for each nested ‘list’ (*note
     list::).  That is, the nominal value for ‘\linewidth’ is to equal
     ‘\textwidth’ but for each nested list the ‘\linewidth’ is decreased
     by the sum of that list's ‘\leftmargin’ and ‘\rightmargin’ (*note
     itemize::).

‘\marginparpush’
‘\marginsep’
‘\marginparwidth’
     The minimum vertical space between two marginal notes, the
     horizontal space between the text body and the marginal notes, and
     the horizontal width of the notes.

     Normally marginal notes appear on the outside of the page, but the
     declaration ‘\reversemarginpar’ changes that (and
     ‘\normalmarginpar’ changes it back).

     The defaults for ‘\marginparpush’ in both ‘book’ and ‘article’
     classes are: ‘7pt’ if the document is set at 12pt, and ‘5pt’ if the
     document is set at 11pt or 10pt.

     For ‘\marginsep’, in ‘article’ class the default is ‘10pt’ except
     if the document is set at 10pt and in two-column mode where the
     default is ‘11pt’.

     For ‘\marginsep’ in ‘book’ class the default is ‘10pt’ in
     two-column mode and ‘7pt’ in one-column mode.

     For ‘\marginparwidth’ in both ‘book’ and ‘article’ classes, in
     two-column mode the default is 60% of ‘\paperwidth − \textwidth’,
     while in one-column mode it is 50% of that distance.

‘\oddsidemargin’
‘\evensidemargin’
     The ‘\oddsidemargin’ length is the extra distance between the left
     side of the page and the text's left margin, on odd-numbered pages
     when the document class option ‘twoside’ is chosen and on all pages
     when ‘oneside’ is in effect.  When ‘twoside’ is in effect, on
     even-numbered pages the extra distance on the left is
     ‘\evensidemargin’.

     LaTeX's default is that ‘\oddsidemargin’ is 40% of the difference
     between ‘\paperwidth’ and ‘\textwidth’, and ‘\evensidemargin’ is
     the remainder.

‘\paperheight’
     The height of the paper, as distinct from the height of the print
     area.  Normally set with a document class option, as in
     ‘\documentclass[a4paper]{article}’ (*note Document class
     options::).

‘\paperwidth’
     The width of the paper, as distinct from the width of the print
     area.  Normally set with a document class option, as in
     ‘\documentclass[a4paper]{article}’ (*note Document class
     options::).

‘\textheight’
     The normal vertical height of the page body.  If the document is
     set at a nominal type size of 10pt then for an ‘article’ or
     ‘report’ the default is ‘43\baselineskip’, while for a ‘book’ it is
     ‘41\baselineskip’.  At a type size of 11pt the default is
     ‘38\baselineskip’ for all document classes.  At 12pt it is
     ‘36\baselineskip’ for all classes.

‘\textwidth’
     The full horizontal width of the entire page body.  For an
     ‘article’ or ‘report’ document, the default is ‘345pt’ when the
     chosen type size is 10pt, the default is ‘360pt’ at 11pt, and it is
     ‘390pt’ at 12pt.  For a ‘book’ document, the default is ‘4.5in’ at
     a type size of 10pt, and ‘5in’ at 11pt or 12pt.

     In multi-column output, ‘\textwidth’ remains the width of the
     entire page body, while ‘\columnwidth’ is the width of one column
     (*note \twocolumn::).

     In lists (*note list::), ‘\textwidth’ remains the width of the
     entire page body (and ‘\columnwidth’ the width of the entire
     column), while ‘\linewidth’ may decrease for nested lists.

     Inside a minipage (*note minipage::) or ‘\parbox’ (*note
     \parbox::), all the width-related parameters are set to the
     specified width, and revert to their normal values at the end of
     the ‘minipage’ or ‘\parbox’.

‘\hsize’
     This entry is included for completeness: ‘\hsize’ is the TeX
     primitive parameter used when text is broken into lines.  It should
     not be used in normal LaTeX documents.

‘\topmargin’
     Space between the top of the TeX page (one inch from the top of the
     paper, by default) and the top of the header.  The value is
     computed based on many other parameters: ‘\paperheight − 2in −
     \headheight − \headsep − \textheight − \footskip’, and then divided
     by two.

‘\topskip’
     Minimum distance between the top of the page body and the baseline
     of the first line of text.  For the standard classes, the default
     is the same as the font size, e.g., ‘10pt’ at a type size of 10pt.

5.6 ‘\baselineskip’ & ‘\baselinestretch’
========================================

The ‘\baselineskip’ is a rubber length (*note Lengths::).  It gives the
“leading”, the normal distance between lines in a paragraph, from
baseline to baseline.

   Ordinarily document authors do not directly change ‘\baselineskip’
while writing.  Instead, it is set by the low level font selection
command ‘\fontsize’ (*note low level font commands fontsize::).  The
‘\baselineskip’'s value is reset every time a font change happens and so
any direct change to ‘\baselineskip’ would vanish the next time there
was a font switch.  For how to influence line spacing, see the
discussion of ‘\baselinestretch’ below.

   Usually, a font's size and baseline skip is assigned by the font
designer.  These numbers are nominal in the sense that if, for instance,
a font's style file has the command ‘\fontsize{10pt}{12pt}’ then that
does not mean that the characters in the font are 10pt tall; for
instance, parentheses and accented capitals may be taller.  Nor does it
mean that if the lines are spaced less than 12pt apart then they risk
touching.  Rather these numbers are typographic judgements.  (Often, the
‘\baselineskip’ is about twenty percent larger than the font size.)

   The ‘\baselineskip’ is not a property of each line but of the entire
paragraph.  As a result, large text in the middle of a paragraph, such
as a single ‘{\Huge Q}’, will be squashed into its line.  TeX will make
sure it doesn't scrape up against the line above but won't change the
‘\baselineskip’ for that one line to make extra room above.  For the
fix, use a ‘\strut’ (*note \strut::).

   The value of ‘\baselineskip’ that TeX uses for the paragraph is the
value in effect at the blank line or command that ends the paragraph
unit.  So if a document contains this paragraph then its lines will be
scrunched together, compared to lines in surrounding paragraphs.

     Many people see a page break between text and a displayed equation as
     bad style, so in effect the display is part of the paragraph.
     Because this display is in footnotesize, the entire paragraph has the
     baseline spacing matching that size.
     {\footnotesize $$a+b = c$$}

   The process for making paragraphs is that when a new line is added,
if the depth of the previous line plus the height of the new line is
less than ‘\baselineskip’ then TeX inserts vertical glue to make up the
difference.  There are two fine points.  The first is that if the lines
would be too close together, closer than ‘\lineskiplimit’, then TeX
instead uses ‘\lineskip’ as the interline glue.  The second is that TeX
doesn't actually use the depth of the previous line.  Instead it uses
‘\prevdepth’, which usually contains that depth.  But at the beginning
of the paragraph (or any vertical list) or just after a rule,
‘\prevdepth’ has the value -1000pt and this special value tells TeX not
to insert any interline glue at the paragraph start.

   In the standard classes ‘\lineskiplimit’ is 0pt and ‘\lineskip’ is
1pt.  By the prior paragraph then, the distance between lines can
approach zero but if it becomes zero (or less than zero) then the lines
jump to 1pt apart.

   Sometimes authors must, for editing purposes, put the document in
double space or one-and-a-half space.  The right way to influence the
interline distance is via ‘\baselinestretch’.  It scales
‘\baselineskip’, and has a default value of 1.0.  It is a command, not a
length, and does not take effect until a font change happens, so set the
scale factor like this:
‘\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.5}\selectfont’.

   The most straightforward way to change the line spacing for an entire
document is to put ‘\linespread{FACTOR}’ in the preamble.  For double
spacing, take FACTOR to be 1.6 and for one-and-a-half spacing use 1.3.
These numbers are rough: for instance, since the ‘\baselineskip’ is
about 1.2 times the font size, multiplying by 1.6 gives a baseline skip
to font size ratio of about 2.  (The ‘\linespread’ command is defined as
‘\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{FACTOR}’ so it also won't take effect
until a font setting happens.  But that always takes place at the start
of a document, so there you don't need to follow it with ‘\selectfont’.)

   A simpler approach is the ‘setspace’ package.  The basic example:

     \usepackage{setspace}
     \doublespacing  % or \onehalfspacing for 1.5

In the preamble these will start the document off with that sizing.  But
you can also use these declarations in the document body to change the
spacing from that point forward, and consequently there is
‘\singlespacing’ to return the spacing to normal.  In the document body,
a better practice than using the declarations is to use environments,
such as ‘\begin{doublespace} ... \end{doublespace}’.  The package also
has commands to do arbitrary spacing: ‘\setstretch{FACTOR}’ and
‘\begin{spacing}{FACTOR} ... \end{spacing}’.  This package also keeps
the line spacing single-spaced in places where that is typically
desirable, such as footnotes and figure captions.  See the package
documentation.

5.7 Floats
==========

Some typographic elements, such as figures and tables, cannot be broken
across pages.  They must be typeset outside of the normal flow of text,
for instance floating to the top of a later page.

   LaTeX can have a number of different classes of floating material.
The default is the two classes, ‘figure’ (*note figure::) and ‘table’
(*note table::), but you can create a new class with the package
‘float’.

   Within any one float class LaTeX always respects the order, so that
the first figure in a document source must be typeset before the second
figure.  However, LaTeX may mix the classes, so it can happen that while
the first table appears in the source before the first figure, it
appears in the output after it.

   The placement of floats is subject to parameters, given below, that
limit the number of floats that can appear at the top of a page, and the
bottom, etc.  If so many floats are queued that the limits prevent them
all from fitting on a page then LaTeX places what it can and defers the
rest to the next page.  In this way, floats may end up being typeset far
from their place in the source.  In particular, a float that is big may
migrate to the end of the document.  In which event, because all floats
in a class must appear in sequential order, every following float in
that class also appears at the end.

   In addition to changing the parameters, for each float you can tweak
where the float placement algorithm tries to place it by using its
PLACEMENT argument.  The possible values are a sequence of the letters
below.  The default for both ‘figure’ and ‘table’, in both ‘article’ and
‘book’ classes, is ‘tbp’.

‘t’
     (Top)--at the top of a text page.

‘b’
     (Bottom)--at the bottom of a text page.  (However, ‘b’ is not
     allowed for full-width floats (‘figure*’) with double-column
     output.  To ameliorate this, use the ‘stfloats’ or ‘dblfloatfix’
     package, but see the discussion at caveats in the FAQ:
     <https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-2colfloat>.

‘h’
     (Here)--at the position in the text where the ‘figure’ environment
     appears.  However, ‘h’ is not allowed by itself; ‘t’ is
     automatically added.

     To absolutely force a float to appear "here", you can
     ‘\usepackage{float}’ and use the ‘H’ specifier which it defines.
     For further discussion, see the FAQ entry at
     <https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-figurehere>.

‘p’
     (Page of floats)--on a separate “float page”, which is a page
     containing no text, only floats.

‘!’
     Used in addition to one of the above; for this float only, LaTeX
     ignores the restrictions on both the number of floats that can
     appear and the relative amounts of float and non-float text on the
     page.  The ‘!’ specifier does _not_ mean "put the float here"; see
     above.

   Note: the order in which letters appear in the PLACEMENT argument
does not change the order in which LaTeX tries to place the float; for
instance, ‘btp’ has the same effect as ‘tbp’.  All that PLACEMENT does
is that if a letter is not present then the algorithm does not try that
location.  Thus, LaTeX's default of ‘tbp’ is to try every location
except placing the float where it occurs in the source.

   To prevent LaTeX from moving floats to the end of the document or a
chapter you can use a ‘\clearpage’ command to start a new page and
insert all pending floats.  If a pagebreak is undesirable then you can
use the ‘afterpage’ package and issue ‘\afterpage{\clearpage}’.  This
will wait until the current page is finished and then flush all
outstanding floats.

   LaTeX can typeset a float before where it appears in the source
(although on the same output page) if there is a ‘t’ specifier in the
PLACEMENT parameter.  If this is not desired, and deleting the ‘t’ is
not acceptable as it keeps the float from being placed at the top of the
next page, then you can prevent it by either using the ‘flafter’ package
or using the command ‘\suppressfloats[t]’, which causes floats for the
top position on this page to moved to the next page.

   Parameters relating to fractions of pages occupied by float and
non-float text (change them with ‘\renewcommand{PARAMETER}{DECIMAL
BETWEEN 0 AND 1}’):

‘\bottomfraction’
     The maximum fraction of the page allowed to be occupied by floats
     at the bottom; default ‘.3’.

‘\floatpagefraction’
     The minimum fraction of a float page that must be occupied by
     floats; default ‘.5’.

‘\textfraction’
     Minimum fraction of a page that must be text; if floats take up too
     much space to preserve this much text, floats will be moved to a
     different page.  The default is ‘.2’.

‘\topfraction’
     Maximum fraction at the top of a page that may be occupied before
     floats; default ‘.7’.

   Parameters relating to vertical space around floats (change them with
a command of the form ‘\setlength{PARAMETER}{LENGTH EXPRESSION}’):

‘\floatsep’
     Space between floats at the top or bottom of a page; default ‘12pt
     plus2pt minus2pt’.

‘\intextsep’
     Space above and below a float in the middle of the main text;
     default ‘12pt plus2pt minus2pt’ for 10 point and 11 point
     documents, and ‘14pt plus4pt minus4pt’ for 12 point documents.

‘\textfloatsep’
     Space between the last (first) float at the top (bottom) of a page;
     default ‘20pt plus2pt minus4pt’.

   Counters relating to the number of floats on a page (change them with
a command of the form ‘\setcounter{CTRNAME}{NATURAL NUMBER}’):

‘bottomnumber’
     Maximum number of floats that can appear at the bottom of a text
     page; default 1.

‘dbltopnumber’
     Maximum number of full-sized floats that can appear at the top of a
     two-column page; default 2.

‘topnumber’
     Maximum number of floats that can appear at the top of a text page;
     default 2.

‘totalnumber’
     Maximum number of floats that can appear on a text page; default 3.

   The principal TeX FAQ entry relating to floats
<https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-floats> contains suggestions for relaxing
LaTeX's default parameters to reduce the problem of floats being pushed
to the end.  A full explanation of the float placement algorithm is in
Frank Mittelbach's article "How to influence the position of float
environments like figure and table in LaTeX?"
(<https://www.latex-project.org/publications/2014-FMi-TUB-tb111mitt-float-placement.pdf>).

5.7.1 ‘\caption’
----------------

Synopsis:

     \caption{CAPTION-TEXT}

or

     \caption[SHORT-CAPTION-TEXT]{CAPTION-TEXT}

   Make a caption for a floating environment, such as a ‘figure’ or
‘table’ environment (*note figure:: or *note table::).

   In this example, LaTeX places a caption below the vertical blank
space that is left by the author for the later inclusion of a picture.

     \begin{figure}
       \vspace*{1cm}
       \caption{Alonzo Cushing, Battery A, 4th US Artillery.}
       \label{fig:CushingPic}
     \end{figure}

The ‘\caption’ command will label the CAPTION-TEXT with something like
‘Figure 1:’ for an article or ‘Figure 1.1:’ for a book.  The text is
centered if it is shorter than the text width, or set as an unindented
paragraph if it takes more than one line.

   In addition to placing the CAPTION-TEXT in the output, the ‘\caption’
command also saves that information for use in a list of figures or list
of tables (*note Table of contents etc.::).

   Here the ‘\caption’ command uses the optional SHORT-CAPTION-TEXT, so
that the shorter text appears in the list of tables, rather than the
longer CAPTION-TEXT.

     \begin{table}
       \centering
       \begin{tabular}{|*{3}{c}|}
         \hline
         4  &9  &2 \\
         3  &5  &7 \\
         8  &1  &6 \\
         \hline
       \end{tabular}
       \caption[\textit{Lo Shu} magic square]{%
         The \textit{Lo Shu} magic square, which is unique among
         squares of order three up to rotation and reflection.}
       \label{tab:LoShu}
     \end{table}

LaTeX will label the CAPTION-TEXT with something like ‘Table 1:’ for an
article or ‘Table 1.1:’ for a book.

   The caption can appear at the top of the ‘figure’ or ‘table’.  For
instance, that would happen in the prior example by putting the
‘\caption’ between the ‘\centering’ and the ‘\begin{tabular}’.

   Different floating environments are numbered separately, by default.
It is ‘\caption’ that updates the counter, and so any ‘\label’ must come
after the ‘\caption’.  The counter for the ‘figure’ environment is named
‘figure’, and similarly the counter for the ‘table’ environment is
‘table’.

   The text that will be put in the list of figures or list of tables is
moving argument.  If you get the LaTeX error ‘! Argument of \@caption
has an extra }’ then you must put ‘\protect’ in front of any fragile
commands.  *Note \protect::.

   The ‘caption’ package has many options to adjust how the caption
appears, for example changing the font size, making the caption be
hanging text rather than set as a paragraph, or making the caption
always set as a paragraph rather than centered when it is short.

6 Sectioning
************

Structure your text into divisions: parts, chapters, sections, etc.  All
sectioning commands have the same form, one of:

     SECTIONING-COMMAND{TITLE}
     SECTIONING-COMMAND*{TITLE}
     SECTIONING-COMMAND[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

For instance, declare the start of a subsection as with
‘\subsection{Motivation}’.

   The table has each SECTIONING-COMMAND in LaTeX.  All are available in
all of LaTeX's standard document classes ‘book’, ‘report’,
and ‘article’, except that ‘\chapter’ is not available in ‘article’.

Sectioning unit    Command            Level
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Part               ‘\part’            -1 (‘book’, ‘report’), 0
                                      (‘article’)
Chapter            ‘\chapter’         0
Section            ‘\section’         1
Subsection         ‘\subsection’      2
Subsubsection      ‘\subsubsection’   3
Paragraph          ‘\paragraph’       4
Subparagraph       ‘\subparagraph’    5

   All these commands have a ‘*’-form that prints TITLE as usual but
does not number it and does not make an entry in the table of contents.
An example of using this is for an appendix in an ‘article’.  The input
‘\appendix\section{Appendix}’ gives the output ‘A Appendix’ (*note
\appendix::).  You can lose the numbering ‘A’ by instead entering
‘\section*{Appendix}’ (articles often omit a table of contents and have
simple page headers so the other differences from the ‘\section’ command
may not matter).

   The section title TITLE provides the heading in the main text, but it
may also appear in the table of contents and in the running head or foot
(*note Page styles::).  You may not want the same text in these places
as in the main text.  All of these commands have an optional argument
TOC-TITLE for these other places.

   The level number in the table above determines which sectional units
are numbered, and which appear in the table of contents.  If the
sectioning command's LEVEL is less than or equal to the value of the
counter ‘secnumdepth’ then the titles for this sectioning command will
be numbered (*note Sectioning/secnumdepth::).  And, if LEVEL is less
than or equal to the value of the counter ‘tocdepth’ then the table of
contents will have an entry for this sectioning unit (*note
Sectioning/tocdepth::).

   LaTeX expects that before you have a ‘\subsection’ you will have a
‘\section’ and, in a ‘book’ class document, that before a ‘\section’ you
will have a ‘\chapter’.  Otherwise you can get something like a
subsection numbered ‘3.0.1’.

   LaTeX lets you change the appearance of the sectional units.  As a
simple example, you can change the section numbering to uppercase
letters with this (in the preamble):
‘\renewcommand\thesection{\Alph{section}}’ .  (*Note \alph \Alph \arabic
\roman \Roman \fnsymbol::.)  CTAN has many packages that make this
adjustment easier, notably ‘titlesec’.

   Two counters relate to the appearance of headings made by sectioning
commands.

‘secnumdepth’
     Controls which sectioning unit are numbered.  Setting the counter
     with ‘\setcounter{secnumdepth}{LEVEL}’ will suppress numbering of
     sectioning at any depth greater than LEVEL (*note \setcounter::).
     See the above table for the level numbers.  For instance, if the
     ‘secnumdepth’ is 1 in an ‘article’ then a ‘\section{Introduction}’
     command will produce output like ‘1 Introduction’ while
     ‘\subsection{Discussion}’ will produce output like ‘Discussion’,
     without the number.  LaTeX's default ‘secnumdepth’ is 3 in
     ‘article’ class and  2 in the ‘book’ and ‘report’ classes.

‘tocdepth’
     Controls which sectioning units are listed in the table of
     contents.  The setting ‘\setcounter{tocdepth}{LEVEL}’ makes the
     sectioning units at LEVEL be the smallest ones listed (*note
     \setcounter::).  See the above table for the level numbers.  For
     instance, if ‘tocdepth’ is 1 then the table of contents will list
     sections but not subsections.  LaTeX's default ‘tocdepth’ is 3 in
     ‘article’ class and  2 in the ‘book’ and ‘report’ classes.

6.1 ‘\part’
===========

Synopsis, one of:

     \part{TITLE}
     \part*{TITLE}
     \part[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

   Start a document part.  The standard LaTeX classes ‘book’, ‘report’,
and ‘article’, all have this command.

   This produces a document part, in a book.

     \part{VOLUME I \\
            PERSONAL MEMOIRS OF  U.\ S.\ GRANT}
     \chapter{ANCESTRY--BIRTH--BOYHOOD.}
     My family is American, and has been for generations,
     in all its branches, direct and collateral.

   In each standard class the ‘\part’ command outputs a part number such
as ‘Part I’, alone on its line, in boldface, and in large type.  Then
LaTeX outputs TITLE, also alone on its line, in bold and in even larger
type.  In class ‘book’, the LaTeX default puts each part alone on its
own page.  If the book is two-sided then LaTeX will skip a page if
needed to have the new part on an odd-numbered page.  In ‘report’ it is
again alone on a page, but LaTeX won't force it onto an odd-numbered
page.  In an ‘article’ LaTeX does not put it on a fresh page, but
instead outputs the part number and part title onto the main document
page.

   The ‘*’ form shows TITLE but it does not show the part number, does
not increment the ‘part’ counter, and produces no table of contents
entry.

   The optional argument TOC-TITLE will appear as the part title in the
table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::) and in running
headers (*note Page styles::).  If it is not present then TITLE will be
there.  This example puts a line break in TITLE but omits the break in
the table of contents.

     \part[Up from the bottom; my life]{Up from the bottom\\ my life}

   For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear
in the table of contents, the level number of a part is -1 (*note
Sectioning/secnumdepth::, and *note Sectioning/tocdepth::).

   In the class ‘article’, if a paragraph immediately follows the part
title then it is not indented.  To get an indent you can use the package
‘indentfirst’.

   One package to change the behavior of ‘\part’ is ‘titlesec’.  See its
documentation on CTAN.

6.2 ‘\chapter’
==============

Synopsis, one of:

     \chapter{TITLE}
     \chapter*{TITLE}
     \chapter[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

   Start a chapter.  The standard LaTeX classes ‘book’ and ‘report’ have
this command but ‘article’ does not.

   This produces a chapter.

     \chapter{Loomings}
     Call me Ishmael.
     Some years ago---never mind how long precisely---having little or no
     money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I
     thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
     the world.

   The LaTeX default starts each chapter on a fresh page, an
odd-numbered page if the document is two-sided.  It produces a chapter
number such as ‘Chapter 1’ in large boldface type (the size is ‘\huge’).
It then puts TITLE on a fresh line, in boldface type that is still
larger (size ‘\Huge’).  It also increments the ‘chapter’ counter, adds
an entry to the table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::), and
sets the running header information (*note Page styles::).

   The ‘*’ form shows TITLE on a fresh line, in boldface.  But it does
not show the chapter number, does not increment the ‘chapter’ counter,
produces no table of contents entry, and does not affect the running
header.  (If you use the page style ‘headings’ in a two-sided document
then the header will be from the prior chapter.)  This example
illustrates.

     \chapter*{Preamble}

   The optional argument TOC-TITLE will appear as the chapter title in
the table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::) and in running
headers (*note Page styles::).  If it is not present then TITLE will be
there.  This shows the full name in the chapter title,

     \chapter[Weyl]{Hermann Klaus Hugo (Peter) Weyl (1885--1955)}

but only ‘Weyl’ on the contents page.  This puts a line break in the
title but that doesn't work well with running headers so it omits the
break in the contents

     \chapter[Given it all; my story]{Given it all\\ my story}

   For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear
in the table of contents, the level number of a chapter is 0 (*note
Sectioning/secnumdepth:: and *note Sectioning/tocdepth::).

   The paragraph that follows the chapter title is not indented, as is a
standard typographical practice.  To get an indent use the package
‘indentfirst’.

   You can change what is shown for the chapter number.  To change it to
something like ‘Lecture 1’, put in the preamble either
‘\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Lecture}’ or this (*note \makeatletter &
\makeatother::).

     \makeatletter
     \renewcommand{\@chapapp}{Lecture}
     \makeatother

To make this change because of the primary language for the document,
see the package ‘babel’.

   In a two-sided document LaTeX puts a chapter on odd-numbered page, if
necessary leaving an even-numbered page that is blank except for any
running headers.  To make that page completely blank, see *note
\clearpage & \cleardoublepage::.

   To change the behavior of the ‘\chapter’ command, you can copy its
definition from the LaTeX format file and make adjustments.  But there
are also many packages on CTAN that address this.  One is ‘titlesec’.
See its documentation, but the example below gives a sense of what it
can do.

     \usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
     \titleformat{\chapter}
       {\Huge\bfseries}  % format of title
       {}                % label, such as 1.2 for a subsection
       {0pt}             % length of separation between label and title
       {}                % before-code hook

This omits the chapter number ‘Chapter 1’ from the page but unlike
‘\chapter*’ it keeps the chapter in the table of contents and the
running headers.

6.3 ‘\section’
==============

Synopsis, one of:

     \section{TITLE}
     \section*{TITLE}
     \section[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

   Start a section.  The standard LaTeX classes ‘article’, ‘book’, and
‘report’ all have this command.

   This produces a section.

     In this Part we tend to be more interested in the function,
     in the input-output behavior,
     than in the details of implementing that behavior.

     \section{Turing machines}
     Despite this desire to downplay implementation,
     we follow the approach of A~Turing that the
     first step toward defining the set of computable functions
     is to reflect on the details of what mechanisms can do.

   For the standard LaTeX classes ‘book’ and ‘report’ the default output
is like ‘1.2 TITLE’ (for chapter 1, section 2), alone on its line and
flush left, in boldface and a larger type (the type size is ‘\Large’).
The same holds in ‘article’ except that there are no chapters in that
class so it looks like ‘2 TITLE’.

   The ‘*’ form shows TITLE.  But it does not show the section number,
does not increment the ‘section’ counter, produces no table of contents
entry, and does not affect the running header.  (If you use the page
style ‘headings’ in a two-sided document then the header will be from
the prior section.)

   The optional argument TOC-TITLE will appear as the section title in
the table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::) and in running
headers (*note Page styles::).  If it is not present then TITLE will be
there.  This shows the full name in the title of the section:

     \section[Elizabeth~II]{Elizabeth the Second,
       by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom,
       Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
       Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.}

but only ‘Elizabeth II’ on the contents page and in the headers.  This
has a line break in TITLE but that does not work with headers so it is
omitted from the contents and headers.

     \section[Truth is, I cheated; my life story]{Truth is,
       I cheated\\my life story}

   For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear
in the table of contents, the level number of a section is 1 (*note
Sectioning/secnumdepth:: and *note Sectioning/tocdepth::).

   The paragraph that follows the section title is not indented, as is a
standard typographical practice.  One way to get an indent is to use the
package ‘indentfirst’.

   In general, to change the behavior of the ‘\section’ command, there
are a number of options.  One is the ‘\@startsection’ command (*note
\@startsection::).  There are also many packages on CTAN that address
this, including ‘titlesec’.  See the documentation but the example below
gives a sense of what they can do.

     \usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
     \titleformat{\section}
       {\normalfont\Large\bfseries}  % format of title
       {\makebox[1pc][r]{\thesection\hspace{1pc}}} % label
       {0pt}                   % length of separation between label and title
       {}                      % before-code hook
     \titlespacing*{\section}
       {-1pc}{18pt}{10pt}[10pc]

That puts the section number in the margin.

6.4 ‘\subsection’
=================

Synopsis, one of:

     \subsection{TITLE}
     \subsection*{TITLE}
     \subsection[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

   Start a subsection.  The standard LaTeX classes ‘article’, ‘book’,
and ‘report’ all have this command.

   This produces a subsection.

     We will show that there are more functions than Turing machines and that
     therefore some functions have no associated machine.

     \subsection{Cardinality} We will begin with two paradoxes that
     dramatize the challenge to our intuition posed by comparing the sizes of
     infinite sets.

   For the standard LaTeX classes ‘book’ and ‘report’ the default output
is like ‘1.2.3 TITLE’ (for chapter 1, section 2, subsection 3), alone on
its line and flush left, in boldface and a larger type (the type size is
‘\large’).  The same holds in ‘article’ except that there are no
chapters in that class so it looks like ‘2.3 TITLE’.

   The ‘*’ form shows TITLE.  But it does not show the subsection
number, does not increment the ‘subsection’ counter, and produces no
table of contents entry.

   The optional argument TOC-TITLE will appear as the subsection title
in the table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::).  If it is not
present then TITLE will be there.  This shows the full text in the title
of the subsection:

     \subsection[$\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ paper]{\textit{The Origin of
       Chemical Elements} by R.A.~Alpher, H.~Bethe, and G.~Gamow}

but only ‘α,β,γ paper’ on the contents page.

   For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear
in the table of contents, the level number of a subsection is 2 (*note
Sectioning/secnumdepth:: and *note Sectioning/tocdepth::).

   The paragraph that follows the subsection title is not indented, as
is a standard typographical practice.  One way to get an indent is to
use the package ‘indentfirst’.

   There are a number of ways to change the behavior of the
‘\subsection’ command.  One is the ‘\@startsection’ command (*note
\@startsection::).  There are also many packages on CTAN that address
this, including ‘titlesec’.  See the documentation but the example below
gives a sense of what they can do.

     \usepackage{titlesec}   % in preamble
     \titleformat{\subsection}[runin]
       {\normalfont\normalsize\bfseries}  % format of the title
       {\thesubsection}                   % label
       {0.6em}                            % space between label and title
       {}                                 % before-code hook

That puts the subsection number and TITLE in the first line of text.

6.5 ‘\subsubsection’, ‘\paragraph’, ‘\subparagraph’
===================================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \subsubsection{TITLE}
     \subsubsection*{TITLE}
     \subsubsection[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

or one of:

     \paragraph{TITLE}
     \paragraph*{TITLE}
     \paragraph[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

or one of:

     \subparagraph{TITLE}
     \subparagraph*{TITLE}
     \subparagraph[TOC-TITLE]{TITLE}

   Start a subsubsection, paragraph, or subparagraph.  The standard
LaTeX classes ‘article’, ‘book’, and ‘report’ all have these commands,
although they are not commonly used.

   This produces a subsubsection.

     \subsubsection{Piston ring compressors: structural performance}
     Provide exterior/interior wall cladding assemblies
     capable of withstanding the effects of load and stresses from
     consumer-grade gasoline engine piston rings.

   The default output of each of the three does not change over the
standard LaTeX classes ‘article’, ‘book’, and ‘report’.  For
‘\subsubsection’ the TITLE is alone on its line, in boldface and normal
size type.  For ‘\paragraph’ the TITLE is inline with the text, not
indented, in boldface and normal size type.  For ‘\subparagraph’ the
TITLE is inline with the text, with a paragraph indent, in boldface and
normal size type (Because an ‘article’ has no chapters its
subsubsections are numbered and so it looks like ‘1.2.3 TITLE’, for
section 1, subsection 2, and subsubsection 3.  The other two divisions
are not numbered.)

   The ‘*’ form shows TITLE.  But it does not increment the associated
counter and produces no table of contents entry (and does not show the
number for ‘\subsubsection’).

   The optional argument TOC-TITLE will appear as the division title in
the table of contents (*note Table of contents etc.::).  If it is not
present then TITLE will be there.

   For determining which sectional units are numbered and which appear
in the table of contents, the level number of a subsubsection is 3, of a
paragraph is 4, and of a subparagraph is 5 (*note
Sectioning/secnumdepth:: and *note Sectioning/tocdepth::).

   The paragraph that follows the subsubsection title is not indented,
as is a standard typographical practice.  One way to get an indent is to
use the package ‘indentfirst’.

   There are a number of ways to change the behavior of the these
commands.  One is the ‘\@startsection’ command (*note \@startsection::).
There are also many packages on CTAN that address this, including
‘titlesec’.  See the documentation on CTAN.

6.6 ‘\appendix’
===============

Synopsis:

     \appendix

   This does not directly produce any output.  But in a ‘book’ or
‘report’ document it declares that subsequent ‘\chapter’ commands start
an appendix.  In an article it does the same, for ‘\section’ commands.
It also resets the ‘chapter’ and ‘section’ counters to 0 in a book or
report, and in an article resets the ‘section’ and ‘subsection’
counters.

   In this book

     \chapter{One}  ...
     \chapter{Two}  ...
      ...
     \appendix
     \chapter{Three}  ...
     \chapter{Four}  ...

the first two will generate output numbered ‘Chapter 1’ and ‘Chapter 2’.
After the ‘\appendix’ the numbering will be ‘Appendix A’ and ‘Appendix
B’.  *Note Larger book template::, for another example.

   The ‘appendix’ package adds the command ‘\appendixpage’ to put a
separate ‘Appendices’ in the document body before the first appendix,
and the command ‘\addappheadtotoc’ to do the same in the table of
contents.  You can reset the name ‘Appendices’ with a command like
‘\renewcommand{\appendixname}{Specification}’, as well as a number of
other features.  See the documentation on CTAN.

6.7 ‘\frontmatter’, ‘\mainmatter’, ‘\backmatter’
================================================

Synopsis, one or more of:

     \frontmatter
     ...
     \mainmatter
     ...
     \backmatter
     ...

   Format a ‘book’ class document differently according to which part of
the document is being produced.  All three commands are optional.

   Traditionally, a book's front matter contains such things as the
title page, an abstract, a table of contents, a preface, a list of
notations, a list of figures, and a list of tables.  (Some of these
front matter pages, such as the title page, are traditionally not
numbered.)  The back matter may contain such things as a glossary,
notes, a bibliography, and an index.

   The ‘\frontmatter’ command makes the pages numbered in lowercase
roman, and makes chapters not numbered, although each chapter's title
appears in the table of contents; if you use other sectioning commands
here, use the ‘*’-version (*note Sectioning::).

   The ‘\mainmatter’ command changes the behavior back to the expected
version, and resets the page number.

   The ‘\backmatter’ command leaves the page numbering alone but
switches the chapters back to being not numbered.

   *Note Larger book template::, for an example using these three
commands.

6.8 ‘\@startsection’: Typesetting sectional unit headings
=========================================================

Synopsis:

     \@startsection{NAME}{LEVEL}{INDENT}{BEFORESKIP}{AFTERSKIP}{STYLE}

   Used to help redefine the behavior of commands that start sectioning
divisions such as ‘\section’ or ‘\subsection’.

   The ‘titlesec’ package makes manipulation of sectioning easier.
Further, while most requirements for sectioning commands can be
satisfied with ‘\@startsection’, some cannot.  For instance, in the
standard LaTeX ‘book’ and ‘report’ classes the commands ‘\chapter’ and
‘\report’ are not constructed using this.  To make such a command you
may want to use the ‘\secdef’ command.

   The ‘\@startsection’ macro is used like this:

     \@startsection{NAME}
       {LEVEL}
       {INDENT}
       {BEFORESKIP}
       {AFTERSKIP}
       {STYLE}*[TOCTITLE]{TITLE}

so that issuing

     \renewcommand{\section}{\@startsection{NAME}
       {LEVEL}
       {INDENT}
       {BEFORESKIP}
       {AFTERSKIP}
       {STYLE}}

redefines ‘\section’ while keeping its standard calling form
‘\section*[TOCTITLE]{TITLE}’ (in which, as a reminder, the star ‘*’ is
optional).  *Note Sectioning::.  This implies that when you write a
command like ‘\renewcommand{\section}{...}’, the ‘\@startsection{...}’
must come last in the definition.  See the examples below.

NAME
     Name of the counter used to number the sectioning header.  This
     counter must be defined separately.  Most commonly this is either
     ‘section’, ‘subsection’, or ‘paragraph’.  Although in those cases
     the counter name is the same as the sectioning command itself, you
     don't have to use the same name.

     Then ‘\the’NAME displays the title number and ‘\’NAME‘mark’ is for
     the page headers.  See the third example below.

LEVEL
     An integer giving the depth of the sectioning command.  *Note
     Sectioning::, for the list of standard level numbers.

     If LEVEL is less than or equal to the value of the counter
     ‘secnumdepth’ then titles for this sectioning command will be
     numbered (*note Sectioning/secnumdepth::).  For instance, if
     ‘secnumdepth’ is 1 in an ‘article’ then the command
     ‘\section{Introduction}’ will produce output like "1 Introduction"
     while ‘\subsection{Discussion}’ will produce output like
     "Discussion", without the number prefix.

     If LEVEL is less than or equal to the value of the counter TOCDEPTH
     then the table of contents will have an entry for this sectioning
     unit (*note Sectioning/tocdepth::).  For instance, in an ‘article’,
     if TOCDEPTH is 1 then the table of contents will list sections but
     not subsections.

INDENT
     A length giving the indentation of all of the title lines with
     respect to the left margin.  To have the title flush with the
     margin use ‘0pt’.  A negative indentation such as ‘-\parindent’
     will move the title into the left margin.

BEFORESKIP
     The absolute value of this length is the amount of vertical space
     that is inserted before this sectioning unit's title.  This space
     will be discarded if the sectioning unit happens to start at the
     beginning of a page.  If this number is negative then the first
     paragraph following the header is not indented; if it is
     non-negative then the first paragraph is indented.  (Example: the
     negative of ‘1pt plus 2pt minus 3pt’ is ‘-1pt plus -2pt minus
     -3pt’.)

     For example, if BEFORESKIP is ‘-3.5ex plus -1ex minus -0.2ex’ then
     to start the new sectioning unit, LaTeX will add about 3.5 times
     the height of a letter x in vertical space, and the first paragraph
     in the section will not be indented.  Using a rubber length, with
     ‘plus’ and ‘minus’, is good practice here since it gives LaTeX more
     flexibility in making up the page (*note Lengths::).

     The full accounting of the vertical space between the baseline of
     the line prior to this sectioning unit's header and the baseline of
     the header is that it is the sum of the ‘\parskip’ of the text
     font, the ‘\baselineskip’ of the title font, and the absolute value
     of the BEFORESKIP.  This space is typically rubber so it may
     stretch or shrink.  (If the sectioning unit starts on a fresh page
     so that the vertical space is discarded then the baseline of the
     header text will be where LaTeX would put the baseline of the first
     text line on that page.)

AFTERSKIP
     This is a length.  If AFTERSKIP is non-negative then this is the
     vertical space inserted after the sectioning unit's title header.
     If it is negative then the title header becomes a run-in header, so
     that it becomes part of the next paragraph.  In this case the
     absolute value of the length gives the horizontal space between the
     end of the title and the beginning of the following paragraph.
     (Note that the negative of ‘1pt plus 2pt minus 3pt’ is ‘-1pt plus
     -2pt minus -3pt’.)

     As with BEFORESKIP, using a rubber length, with ‘plus’ and ‘minus’
     components, is good practice here since it gives LaTeX more
     flexibility in putting together the page.

     If ‘afterskip’ is non-negative then the full accounting of the
     vertical space between the baseline of the sectioning unit's header
     and the baseline of the first line of the following paragraph is
     that it is the sum of the ‘\parskip’ of the title font, the
     ‘\baselineskip’ of the text font, and the value of AFTER.  That
     space is typically rubber so it may stretch or shrink.  (Note that
     because the sign of ‘afterskip’ changes the sectioning unit
     header's from standalone to run-in, you cannot use a negative
     ‘afterskip’ to cancel part of the ‘\parskip’.)

STYLE
     Controls the styling of the title.  See the examples below.
     Typical commands to use here are ‘\centering’, ‘\raggedright’,
     ‘\normalfont’, ‘\hrule’, or ‘\newpage’.  The last command in STYLE
     may be one that takes one argument, such as ‘\MakeUppercase’ or
     ‘\fbox’ that takes one argument.  The section title will be
     supplied as the argument to this command.  For instance, setting
     STYLE to ‘\bfseries\MakeUppercase’ would produce titles that are
     bold and uppercase.

   These are LaTeX's defaults for the first three sectioning units that
are defined with ‘\@startsection’, for the ‘article’, ‘book’, and
‘report’ classes.

   • For ‘section’: LEVEL is 1, INDENT is 0pt, BEFORESKIP is ‘-3.5ex
     plus -1ex minus -0.2ex’, AFTERSKIP is ‘2.3ex plus 0.2ex’, and STYLE
     is ‘\normalfont\Large\bfseries’.

   • For ‘subsection’: LEVEL is 2, INDENT is 0pt, BEFORESKIP is ‘-3.25ex
     plus -1ex minus -0.2ex’, AFTERSKIP is ‘1.5ex plus 0.2ex’, and STYLE
     is ‘\normalfont\large\bfseries’.

   • For ‘subsubsection’: LEVEL is 3, INDENT is 0pt, BEFORESKIP is
     ‘-3.25ex plus -1ex minus -0.2ex’, AFTERSKIP is ‘1.5ex plus 0.2ex’,
     and STYLE is ‘\normalfont\normalsize\bfseries’.

   Some examples follow.  These go either in a package or class file or
in the preamble of a LaTeX document.  If you put them in the preamble
they must go between a ‘\makeatletter’ command and a ‘\makeatother’.
(Probably the error message ‘You can't use `\spacefactor' in vertical
mode.’ means that you forgot this.)  *Note \makeatletter &
\makeatother::.

   This will put section titles in large boldface type, centered.  It
says ‘\renewcommand’ because LaTeX's standard classes have already
defined a ‘\section’.  For the same reason it does not define a
‘section’ counter, or the commands ‘\thesection’ and ‘\l@section’.

     \renewcommand\section{%
       \@startsection{section}% *note NAME: \@startsection/name.
         {1}% *note LEVEL: \@startsection/level.
         {0pt}% *note INDENT: \@startsection/indent.
         {-3.5ex plus -1ex minus -.2ex}% *note BEFORESKIP: \@startsection/beforeskip.
         {2.3ex plus.2ex}% *note AFTERSKIP: \@startsection/afterskip.
         {\centering\normalfont\Large\bfseries}% *note STYLE: \@startsection/style.
       }

   This will put ‘subsection’ titles in small caps type, inline with the
paragraph.

     \renewcommand\subsection{%
       \@startsection{subsection}%  *note NAME: \@startsection/name.
         {2}% *note LEVEL: \@startsection/level.
         {0em}% *note INDENT: \@startsection/indent.
         {-1ex plus 0.1ex minus -0.05ex}% *note BEFORESKIP: \@startsection/beforeskip.
         {-1em plus 0.2em}% *note AFTERSKIP: \@startsection/afterskip.
         {\scshape}% *note STYLE: \@startsection/style.
       }

   The prior examples redefined existing sectional unit title commands.
This defines a new one, illustrating the needed counter and macros to
display that counter.

     \setcounter{secnumdepth}{6}% show counters this far down
     \newcounter{subsubparagraph}[subparagraph]% counter for numbering
     \renewcommand{\thesubsubparagraph}%               how to display
       {\thesubparagraph.\@arabic\c@subsubparagraph}%  numbering
     \newcommand{\subsubparagraph}{\@startsection
                              {subsubparagraph}%
                              {6}%
                              {0em}%
                              {\baselineskip}%
                              {0.5\baselineskip}%
                              {\normalfont\normalsize}}
     \newcommand*\l@subsubparagraph{\@dottedtocline{6}{10em}{5em}}% for toc

7 Cross references
******************

We often want something like ‘See Theorem~31’.  But by-hand typing the
31 is poor practice.  Instead you should write a “label” such as
‘\label{eq:GreensThm}’ and then “reference” it, as with ‘See
equation~\ref{eq:GreensThm}’.  LaTeX will automatically work out the
number, put it into the output, and will change that number later if
needed.

     We will see this with Theorem~\ref{th:GreensThm}. % forward reference
     ...
     \begin{theorem} \label{th:GreensThm}
       ...
     \end{theorem}
     ...
     See Theorem~\ref{th:GreensThm} on page~\pageref{th:GreensThm}.

   LaTeX tracks cross reference information in a file having the
extension ‘.aux’ and with the same base name as the file containing the
‘\label’.  So if ‘\label’ is in ‘calculus.tex’ then the information is
in ‘calculus.aux’.  LaTeX puts the information in that file every time
it runs across a ‘\label’.

   The behavior described in the prior paragraph results in a quirk that
happens when your document has a “forward reference”, a ‘\ref’ that
appears before the associated ‘\label’.  If this is the first time that
you are compiling the document then you will get ‘LaTeX Warning:
Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross references right’ and in
the output the forward reference will appear as two question marks ‘??’,
in boldface.  A similar thing happens if you change some things so the
references changes; you get the same warning and the output contains the
old reference information.  In both cases, resolve this by compiling the
document a second time.

   The ‘cleveref’ package enhances LaTeX's cross referencing features.
You can arrange that if you enter
‘\begin{thm}\label{th:Nerode}...\end{thm}’ then ‘\cref{th:Nerode}’ will
output ‘Theorem 3.21’, without you having to enter the "Theorem."

7.1 ‘\label’
============

Synopsis:

     \label{KEY}

   Assign a reference number to KEY.  In ordinary text ‘\label{KEY}’
assigns to KEY the number of the current sectional unit.  Inside an
environment with numbering, such as a ‘table’ or ‘theorem’ environment,
‘\label{KEY}’ assigns to KEY the number of that environment.  Retrieve
the assigned number with the ‘\ref{KEY}’ command (*note \ref::).

   A key name can consist of any sequence of letters, digits, or common
punctuation characters.  Upper and lowercase letters are distinguished,
as usual.

   A common convention is to use labels consisting of a prefix and a
suffix separated by a colon or period.  Thus, ‘\label{fig:Post}’ is a
label for a figure with a portrait of Emil Post.  This helps to avoid
accidentally creating two labels with the same name, and makes your
source more readable.  Some commonly-used prefixes:

‘ch’
     for chapters

‘sec’
‘subsec’
     for lower-level sectioning commands

‘fig’
     for figures

‘tab’
     for tables

‘eq’
     for equations

   In the auxiliary file the reference information is kept as the text
of a command of the form ‘\newlabel{LABEL}{{CURRENTLABEL}{PAGENUMBER}}’.
Here CURRENTLABEL is the current value of the macro ‘\@currentlabel’
that is usually updated whenever you call ‘\refstepcounter{COUNTER}’.

   Below, the key ‘sec:test’ will get the number of the current section
and the key ‘fig:test’ will get the number of the figure.
(Incidentally, put labels after captions in figures and tables.)

     \section{section name}
     \label{sec:test}
     This is Section~\ref{sec:test}.
     \begin{figure}
       ...
       \caption{caption text}
       \label{fig:test}
     \end{figure}
     See Figure~\ref{fig:test}.

7.2 ‘\pageref’
==============

Synopsis:

     \pageref{KEY}

   Produce the page number of the place in the text where the
corresponding ‘\label’{KEY} command appears.

   If there is no ‘\label{KEY}’ then you get something like ‘LaTeX
Warning: Reference `th:GrensThm' on page 1 undefined on input line 11.’

   Below, the ‘\label{eq:main}’ is used both for the formula number and
for the page number.  (Note that the two references are forward
references so this document would need to be compiled twice to resolve
those.)

     The main result is formula~\ref{eq:main} on page~\pageref{eq:main}.
       ...
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:main}
        \mathbf{P}=\mathbf{NP}
     \end{equation}

7.3 ‘\ref’
==========

Synopsis:

     \ref{KEY}

   Produces the number of the sectional unit, equation, footnote,
figure, ..., of the corresponding ‘\label’ command (*note \label::).  It
does not produce any text, such as the word 'Section' or 'Figure', just
the bare number itself.

   If there is no ‘\label{KEY}’ then you get something like ‘LaTeX
Warning: Reference `th:GrensThm' on page 1 undefined on input line 11.’

   In this example the ‘\ref{popular}’ produces ‘2’.  Note that it is a
forward reference since it comes before ‘\label{popular}’ so this
document would have to be compiled twice.

     The most widely-used format is item number~\ref{popular}.
     \begin{enumerate}
     \item Plain \TeX
     \item \label{popular} \LaTeX
     \item Con\TeX t
     \end{enumerate}

   The ‘cleveref’ package includes text such as ‘Theorem’ in the
reference.  See the documentation on CTAN.

7.4 ‘xr’ package
================

Synopsis:

     \usepackage{xr}
       \externaldocument{DOCUMENT-BASENAME}

or

     \usepackage{xr}
       \externaldocument[REFERENCE-PREFIX]{DOCUMENT-BASENAME}

   Make cross references to the external document
‘DOCUMENT-BASENAME.tex’.

   Here is an example.  If ‘lectures.tex’ has this in the preamble

     \usepackage{xr}
       \externaldocument{exercises}
       \externaldocument[H-]{hints}
       \externaldocument{answers}

then it can use cross reference labels from the other three documents.
Suppose that ‘exercises.tex’ has an enumerated list containing this,

     \item \label{exer:EulersThm} What if every vertex has odd degree?

and ‘hints.tex’ has an enumerated list with this,

     \item \label{exer:EulersThm} Distinguish the case of two vertices.

and ‘answers.tex’ has an enumerated list with this,

     \item \label{ans:EulersThm} There is no Euler path, except if there
       are exactly two vertices.

   After compiling the exercises, hints, and answers documents, entering
this in the body of ‘lectures.tex’ will result in the lectures getting
the reference numbers used in the other documents.

     See Exercise~\ref{exer:EulersThm}, with Hint~\ref{H-exer:EulersThm}.
     The solution is Answer~\ref{ans:EulersThm}.

   The prefix ‘H-’ for the reference from the hints file is needed
because the label in the hints file is the same as the label in the
exercises file.  Without that prefix, both references would get the
number from the later file.

   Note: if the document uses the ‘hyperref’ package then in place of
‘xr’, put ‘\usepackage{xr-hyper}’ before the ‘\usepackage{hyperref}’.
Also, if any of the multiple documents uses ‘hyperref’ then they all
must use it.

8 Environments
**************

LaTeX provides many environments for delimiting certain behavior.  An
environment begins with ‘\begin’ and ends with ‘\end’, like this:

     \begin{ENVIRONMENT-NAME}
       ...
     \end{ENVIRONMENT-NAME}

   The ENVIRONMENT-NAME at the beginning must exactly match that at the
end.  For instance, the input ‘\begin{table*}...\end{table}’ will cause
an error like: ‘! LaTeX Error: \begin{table*} on input line 5 ended by
\end{table}.’

   Environments are executed within a group.

8.1 ‘abstract’
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{abstract}
     ...
     \end{abstract}

   Produce an abstract, possibly of multiple paragraphs.  This
environment is only defined in the ‘article’ and ‘report’ document
classes (*note Document classes::).

   Using the example below in the ‘article’ class produces a displayed
paragraph.  Document class option ‘titlepage’ causes the abstract to be
on a separate page (*note Document class options::); this is the default
only in the ‘report’ class.

     \begin{abstract}
       We compare all known accounts of the proposal made by Porter Alexander
       to Robert E Lee at the Appomattox Court House that the army continue
       in a guerrilla war, which Lee refused.
     \end{abstract}

   The next example produces a one column abstract in a two column
document (for a more flexible solution, use the package ‘abstract’).

     \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
       ...
     \begin{document}

8.2 ‘array’
===========

Synopsis:

     \begin{array}{COLS}
       COLUMN 1 ENTRY &COLUMN 2 ENTRY ... &COLUMN N ENTRY \\
       ...
     \end{array}

or:

     \begin{array}[POS]{COLS}
       COLUMN 1 ENTRY &COLUMN 2 ENTRY ... &COLUMN N ENTRY \\
       ...
     \end{array}

   Produce a mathematical array.  This environment can only be used in
math mode (*note Modes::), and normally appears within a displayed
mathematics environment such as ‘equation’ (*note equation::).  Inside
of each row the column entries are separated by an ampersand, (‘&’).
Rows are terminated with double-backslashes (*note \\::).

   This example shows a three by three array.

     \begin{equation*}
       \chi(x) =
       \left|              % vertical bar fence
         \begin{array}{ccc}
           x-a  &-b  &-c  \\
           -d   &x-e &-f  \\
           -g   &-h  &x-i
         \end{array}
      \right|
     \end{equation*}

   The required argument COLS describes the number of columns, their
alignment, and the formatting of the intercolumn regions.  For instance,
‘\begin{array}{rcl}...\end{array}’ gives three columns: the first flush
right, the second centered, and the third flush left.  See *note
tabular:: for the complete description of COLS and of the other common
features of the two environments, including the optional POS argument.

   There are two ways that ‘array’ diverges from ‘tabular’.  The first
is that ‘array’ entries are typeset in math mode, in textstyle (*note
Math styles::) except if the COLS definition specifies the column with
‘p{...}’, which causes the entry to be typeset in text mode.  The second
is that, instead of ‘tabular’'s parameter ‘\tabcolsep’, LaTeX's
intercolumn space in an ‘array’ is governed by ‘\arraycolsep’, which
gives half the width between columns.  The default for this is ‘5pt’ so
that between two columns comes 10pt of space.

   To obtain arrays with braces the standard is to use the ‘amsmath’
package.  It comes with environments ‘pmatrix’ for an array surrounded
by parentheses ‘(...)’, ‘bmatrix’ for an array surrounded by square
brackets ‘[...]’, ‘Bmatrix’ for an array surrounded by curly
braces ‘{...}’, ‘vmatrix’ for an array surrounded by vertical
bars ‘|...|’, and ‘Vmatrix’ for an array surrounded by double vertical
bars ‘||...||’, along with a number of other array constructs.

   The next example uses the ‘amsmath’ package.

     \usepackage{amsmath}  % in preamble

     \begin{equation}
       \begin{vmatrix}{cc}  % array with vert lines
         a  &b \\
         c  &d
       \end{vmatrix}=ad-bc
     \end{equation}

   There are many packages concerning arrays.  The ‘array’ package has
many useful extensions, including more column types.  The ‘dcolumn’
package adds a column type to center on a decimal point.  For both see
the documentation on CTAN.

8.3 ‘center’
============

Synopsis:

     \begin{center}
       LINE1 \\
       LINE2 \\
       ...
     \end{center}

   Create a new paragraph consisting of a sequence of lines that are
centered within the left and right margins.  Use double-backslash, ‘\\’,
to get a line break (*note \\::).  If some text is too long to fit on a
line then LaTeX will insert line breaks that avoid hyphenation and avoid
stretching or shrinking any interword space.

   This environment inserts space above and below the text body.  See
*note \centering:: to avoid such space, for example inside a ‘figure’
environment.

   This example produces three centered lines.  There is extra vertical
space between the last two lines.

     \begin{center}
       A Thesis Submitted in Partial Fufillment \\
       of the Requirements of \\[0.5ex]
       the School of Environmental Engineering
     \end{center}

   In this example, depending on the page's line width, LaTeX may choose
a line break for the part before the double backslash.  If so, it will
center each of the two lines and if not it will center the single line.
Then LaTeX will break at the double backslash, and will center the
ending.

     \begin{center}
       My father considered that anyone who went to chapel and didn't drink
       alcohol was not to be tolerated.\\
       I grew up in that belief.  ---Richard Burton
     \end{center}

   A double backslash after the final line is optional.  If present it
doesn't add any vertical space.

   In a two-column document the text is centered in a column, not in the
entire page.

* Menu:

* \centering::          Declaration form of the ‘center’ environment.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \centering,  Up: center

8.3.1 ‘\centering’
------------------

Synopsis:

     {\centering ... }

or

     \begin{group}
       \centering ...
     \end{group}

   Center the material in its scope.  It is most often used inside an
environment such as ‘figure’, or in a ‘parbox’.

   This example's ‘\centering’ declaration causes the graphic to be
horizontally centered.

     \begin{figure}
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ctan_lion.png}
       \caption{CTAN Lion}  \label{fig:CTANLion}
     \end{figure}

The scope of this ‘\centering’ ends with the ‘\end{figure}’.

   Unlike the ‘center’ environment, the ‘\centering’ command does not
add vertical space above and below the text.  That's its advantage in
the above example; there is not an excess of space.

   It also does not start a new paragraph; it simply changes how LaTeX
formats paragraph units.  If ‘ww {\centering xx \\ yy} zz’ is surrounded
by blank lines then LaTeX will create a paragraph whose first line ‘ww
xx’ is centered and whose second line, not centered, contains ‘yy zz’.
Usually what is desired is for the scope of the declaration to contain a
blank line or the ‘\end’ command of an environment such as ‘figure’ or
‘table’ that ends the paragraph unit.  Thus, if ‘{\centering xx \\
yy\par} zz’ is surrounded by blank lines then it makes a new paragraph
with two centered lines ‘xx’ and ‘yy’, followed by a new paragraph with
‘zz’ that is formatted as usual.

8.4 ‘description’
=================

Synopsis:

     \begin{description}
       \item[LABEL OF FIRST ITEM] TEXT OF FIRST ITEM
       \item[LABEL OF SECOND ITEM] TEXT OF SECOND ITEM
        ...
     \end{description}

   Environment to make a list of labeled items.  Each item's LABEL is
typeset in bold and is flush left, so that long labels continue into the
first line of the item text.  There must be at least one item; having
none causes the LaTeX error ‘Something's wrong--perhaps a missing
\item’.

   This example shows the environment used for a sequence of
definitions.

     \begin{description}
       \item[lama] A priest.
       \item[llama] A beast.
     \end{description}

The labels ‘lama’ and ‘llama’ are output in boldface, with the left edge
on the left margin.

   Start list items with the ‘\item’ command (*note \item::).  Use the
optional labels, as in ‘\item[Main point]’, because there is no sensible
default.  Following the ‘\item’ is optional text, which may contain
multiple paragraphs.

   Since the labels are in bold style, if the label text calls for a
font change given in argument style (see *note Font styles::) then it
will come out bold.  For instance, if the label text calls for
typewriter with ‘\item[\texttt{label text}]’ then it will appear in bold
typewriter, if that is available.  The simplest way around this, in this
example to get non-bold typewriter, is to use declarative style:
‘\item[{\tt label text}]’.  Similarly, get the standard roman font with
‘\item[{\rm label text}]’.

   For other major LaTeX labelled list environments, see *note itemize::
and *note enumerate::.  Unlike those environments, nesting ‘description’
environments does not change the default label; it is boldface and flush
left at all levels.

   For information about list layout parameters, including the default
values, and for information about customizing list layout, see *note
list::.  The package ‘enumitem’ is useful for customizing lists.

   This example changes the description labels to small caps.

     \renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[1]{%
       {\hspace{\labelsep}\textsc{#1}}}

8.5 ‘displaymath’
=================

Synopsis:

     \begin{displaymath}
       MATHEMATICAL TEXT
     \end{displaymath}

   Environment to typeset the MATHEMATICAL TEXT on its own line, in
display style and centered.  To make the text be flush-left use the
global option ‘fleqn’; see *note Document class options::.

   In the ‘displaymath’ environment no equation number is added to the
math text.  One way to get an equation number is to use the ‘equation’
environment (*note equation::).

   LaTeX will not break the MATH TEXT across lines.

   Note that the ‘amsmath’ package has significantly more extensive
displayed equation facilities.  For example, there are a number of ways
in that package for having math text broken across lines.

   The construct ‘\[ MATH \]’ is a synonym for the environment
‘\begin{displaymath} MATH \end{displaymath}’ but the latter is easier to
work with in the source; for instance, searching for a square bracket
may get false positives but the word ‘displaymath’ will likely be
unique.

   The construct ‘$$MATH$$’ from Plain TeX is sometimes used as a
synonym for LaTeX's ‘displaymath’.  It is not a synonym, and is not
officially supported in LaTeX at all; ‘$$’ doesn't support the ‘fleqn’
option (*note Document class options::), has different vertical spacing,
and doesn't perform consistency checks.

   The output from this example is centered and alone on its line.

     \begin{displaymath}
       \int_1^2 x^2\,dx=7/3
     \end{displaymath}

Also, the integral sign is larger than the inline version ‘\( \int_1^2
x^2\,dx=7/3 \)’ produces.

8.6.1 ‘\AtBeginDocument’
------------------------

Synopsis:

     \AtBeginDocument{CODE}

   Save CODE and execute it when ‘\begin{document}’ is executed, at the
very end of the preamble.  The code is executed after the font selection
tables have been set up, so the normal font for the document is the
current font.  However, the code is executed as part of the preamble so
you cannot do any typesetting with it.

   You can issue this command more than once; the successive code lines
will be executed in the order that you gave them.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \AtEndDocument,  Prev: \AtBeginDocument,  Up: document

8.6.2 ‘\AtEndDocument’
----------------------

Synopsis:

     \AtEndDocument{CODE}

   Save CODE and execute it near the end of the document.  Specifically,
it is executed when ‘\end{document}’ is executed, before the final page
is finished and before any leftover floating environments are processed.
If you want some of the code to be executed after these two processes
then include a ‘\clearpage’ at the appropriate point in CODE.

   You can issue this command more than once; the successive code lines
will be executed in the order that you gave them.

8.7 ‘enumerate’
===============

Synopsis:

     \begin{enumerate}
       \item[OPTIONAL LABEL OF FIRST ITEM] TEXT OF FIRST ITEM
       \item[OPTIONAL LABEL OF SECOND ITEM] TEXT OF SECOND ITEM
       ...
     \end{enumerate}

   Environment to produce a numbered list of items.  The format of the
label numbering depends on the nesting level of this environment; see
below.  The default top-level numbering is ‘1.’, ‘2.’, etc.  Each
‘enumerate’ list environment must have at least one item; having none
causes the LaTeX error ‘Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item’.

   This example gives the first two finishers in the 1908 Olympic
marathon.  As a top-level list the labels would come out as ‘1.’ and
‘2.’.

     \begin{enumerate}
      \item Johnny Hayes (USA)
      \item Charles Hefferon (RSA)
     \end{enumerate}

   Start list items with the ‘\item’ command (*note \item::).  If you
give ‘\item’ an optional argument by following it with square brackets,
as in ‘\item[Interstitial label]’, then the next item will continue the
interrupted sequence (*note \item::).  That is, you will get labels like
‘1.’, then ‘Interstitial label’, then ‘2.’.  Following the ‘\item’ is
optional text, which may contain multiple paragraphs.

   Enumerations may be nested within other ‘enumerate’ environments, or
within any paragraph-making environment such as ‘itemize’ (*note
itemize::), up to four levels deep.  This gives LaTeX's default for the
format at each nesting level, where 1 is the top level, the outermost
level.

  1. arabic number followed by a period: ‘1.’, ‘2.’, ...
  2. lowercase letter inside parentheses: ‘(a)’, ‘(b)’ ...
  3. lowercase roman numeral followed by a period: ‘i.’, ‘ii.’, ...
  4. uppercase letter followed by a period: ‘A.’, ‘B.’, ...

   The ‘enumerate’ environment uses the counters ‘\enumi’ through
‘\enumiv’ (*note Counters::).

   For other major LaTeX labeled list environments, see *note
description:: and *note itemize::.  For information about list layout
parameters, including the default values, and for information about
customizing list layout, see *note list::.  The package ‘enumitem’ is
useful for customizing lists.

   To change the format of the label use ‘\renewcommand’ (*note
\newcommand & \renewcommand::) on the commands ‘\labelenumi’ through
‘\labelenumiv’.  For instance, this first level list will be labelled
with uppercase letters, in boldface, and without a trailing period.

     \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\Alph{enumi}}}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item Shows as boldface A
       \item Shows as boldface B
     \end{enumerate}

   For a list of counter-labeling commands see *note \alph \Alph \arabic
\roman \Roman \fnsymbol::.

8.8 ‘eqnarray’
==============

The ‘eqnarray’ environment is obsolete.  It has infelicities, including
spacing that is inconsistent with other mathematics elements.  (See
"Avoid eqnarray!" by Lars Madsen
<https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb33-1/tb103madsen.pdf>).  New documents should
include the ‘amsmath’ package and use the displayed mathematics
environments provided there, such as the ‘align’ environment.  We
include a description only for completeness and for working with old
documents.

   Synopsis:

     \begin{eqnarray}
       FIRST FORMULA LEFT  &FIRST FORMULA MIDDLE  &FIRST FORMULA RIGHT \\
       ...
     \end{eqnarray}

or

     \begin{eqnarray*}
       FIRST FORMULA LEFT  &FIRST FORMULA MIDDLE  &FIRST FORMULA RIGHT \\
       ...
     \end{eqnarray*}

   Display a sequence of equations or inequalities.  The left and right
sides are typeset in display mode, while the middle is typeset in text
mode.

   It is similar to a three-column ‘array’ environment, with items
within a row separated by an ampersand (‘&’), and with rows separated by
double backslash  ‘\\’).  The starred form of line break (‘\\*’) can
also be used to separate equations, and will disallow a page break there
(*note \\::).

   The unstarred form ‘eqnarray’ places an equation number on every line
(using the ‘equation’ counter), unless that line contains a ‘\nonumber’
command.  The starred form ‘eqnarray*’ omits equation numbering, while
otherwise being the same.

   The command ‘\lefteqn’ is used for splitting long formulas across
lines.  It typesets its argument in display style flush left in a box of
zero width.

   This example shows three lines.  The first two lines make an
inequality, while the third line has not entry on the left side.

     \begin{eqnarray*}
       \lefteqn{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}     \\
         &\leq &y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_n      \\
         &=    &z+y_3+\cdots+y_n
     \end{eqnarray*}

8.9 ‘equation’
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{equation}
       MATHEMATICAL TEXT
     \end{equation}

   The same as a ‘displaymath’ environment (*note displaymath::) except
that LaTeX puts an equation number flush to the right margin.  The
equation number is generated using the ‘equation’ counter.

   You should have no blank lines between ‘\begin{equation}’ and
‘\end{equation}’, or LaTeX will tell you that there is a missing dollar
sign.

   The package ‘amsmath’ package has extensive displayed equation
facilities.  New documents should include this package.

8.10 ‘figure’
=============

Synopsis:

     \begin{figure}[PLACEMENT]
       FIGURE BODY
       \caption[LOFTITLE]{TITLE}  % optional
       \label{LABEL}              % optional
     \end{figure}

or:

     \begin{figure*}[PLACEMENT]
       FIGURE BODY
       \caption[LOFTITLE]{TITLE}  % optional
       \label{LABEL}              % optional
     \end{figure*}

   Figures are for material that is not part of the normal text.  An
example is material that you cannot have split between two pages, such
as a graphic.  Because of this, LaTeX does not typeset figures in
sequence with normal text but instead "floats" them to a convenient
place, such as the top of a following page (*note Floats::).

   The FIGURE BODY can consist of imported graphics (*note Graphics::),
or text, LaTeX commands, etc.  It is typeset in a ‘parbox’ of width
‘\textwidth’.

   The possible values of PLACEMENT are ‘h’ for ‘here’, ‘t’ for ‘top’,
‘b’ for ‘bottom’, and ‘p’ for ‘on a separate page of floats’.  For the
effect of these options on the float placement algorithm, see *note
Floats::.

   The starred form ‘figure*’ is used when a document is in
double-column mode (*note \twocolumn::).  It produces a figure that
spans both columns, at the top of the page.  To add the possibility of
placing at a page bottom see the discussion of PLACEMENT ‘b’ in *note
Floats::.

   The label is optional; it is used for cross references (*note Cross
references::).  The optional ‘\caption’ command specifies caption text
for the figure (*note \caption::).  By default it is numbered.  If
LOFTITLE is present, it is used in the list of figures instead of TITLE
(*note Table of contents etc.::).

   This example makes a figure out of a graphic.  LaTeX will place that
graphic and its caption at the top of a page or, if it is pushed to the
end of the document, on a page of floats.

8.11 ‘filecontents’
===================

Synopsis:

     \begin{filecontents}[OPTION]{FILENAME}
       TEXT
     \end{filecontents}

or

     \begin{filecontents*}[OPTION]{FILENAME}
       TEXT
     \end{filecontents*}

   Create a file named FILENAME in the current directory (or the output
directory, if specified; *note output directory::) and write TEXT to it.
By default, an existing file is not overwritten.

   The unstarred version of the environment ‘filecontents’ prefixes the
content of the created file with a header of TeX comments; see the
example below.  The starred version ‘filecontents*’ does not include the
header.

   The possible options are:

‘force’
‘overwrite’
     Overwrite an existing file.

‘noheader’
     Omit the header.  Equivalent to using ‘filecontents*’.

‘nosearch’
     Only check the current directory (and the output directory, if
     specified) for an existing file, not the entire search path.

   These options were added in a 2019 release of LaTeX.

   This environment can be used anywhere in the preamble, although it
often appears before the ‘\documentclass’ command.  It is commonly used
to create a ‘.bib’ or other such data file from the main document
source, to make the source file self-contained.  Similarly, it can be
used to create a custom style or class file, again making the source
self-contained.

   For example, this document:

     \documentclass{article}
     \begin{filecontents}{JH.sty}
     \newcommand{\myname}{Jim Hef{}feron}
     \end{filecontents}
     \usepackage{JH}
     \begin{document}
     Article by \myname.
     \end{document}

produces this file ‘JH.sty’:

     %% LaTeX2e file `JH.sty'
     %% generated by the `filecontents' environment
     %% from source `test' on 2015/10/12.

================

Synopsis:

     \begin{flushleft}
       LINE1 \\
       LINE2 \\
       ...
     \end{flushleft}

   An environment that creates a paragraph whose lines are flush to the
left-hand margin, and ragged right.  If you have lines that are too long
then LaTeX will linebreak them in a way that avoids hyphenation and
stretching or shrinking interword spaces.  To force a new line use a
double backslash, ‘\\’.  For the declaration form see *note
\raggedright::.

   This creates a box of text that is at most 3 inches wide, with the
text flush left and ragged right.

     \noindent\begin{minipage}{3in}
     \begin{flushleft}
       A long sentence that will be broken by \LaTeX{}

or

     \begin{ENVIRONMENT} \raggedright

     \end{ENVIRONMENT}

   A declaration which causes lines to be flush to the left margin and
ragged right.  It can be used inside an ENVIRONMENT such as ‘quote’ or
in a ‘parbox’.  For the environment form see *note flushleft::.

   Unlike the ‘flushleft’ environment, the ‘\raggedright’ command does
not start a new paragraph; it only changes how LaTeX formats paragraph
units.  To affect a paragraph unit's format, the scope of the
declaration must contain the blank line or ‘\end’ command that ends the
paragraph unit.

   Here ‘\raggedright’ in each second column keeps LaTeX from doing
awkward typesetting to fit the text into the narrow column.  Note that
‘\raggedright’ is inside the curly braces ‘{...}’ to delimit its effect.

8.14 ‘itemize’
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{itemize}
       \item[OPTIONAL LABEL OF FIRST ITEM] TEXT OF FIRST ITEM
       \item[OPTIONAL LABEL OF SECOND ITEM] TEXT OF SECOND ITEM
       ...
     \end{itemize}

   Produce an “unordered list”, sometimes called a bullet list.  There
must be at least one ‘\item’ within the environment; having none causes
the LaTeX error ‘Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item’.

   This gives a two-item list.

     \begin{itemize}
      \item Pencil and watercolor sketch by Cassandra
      \item Rice portrait
     \end{itemize}

With the default locale--without loading e.g. ‘babel’ package with
another language than USenglish--as a top-level list each label would
come out as a bullet, •.  The format of the labeling depends on the
nesting level; see below.

   Start list items with the ‘\item’ command (*note \item::).  If you
give ‘\item’ an optional argument by following it with square brackets,
as in ‘\item[OPTIONAL LABEL]’, then by default OPTIONAL LABEL will
appear in bold and be flush right, so it could extend into the left
margin.  For labels that are flush left see the *note description::
environment.  Following the ‘\item’ is the text of the item, which may
be empty or contain multiple paragraphs.

   Unordered lists can be nested within one another, up to four levels
deep.  They can also be nested within other paragraph-making
environments, such as ‘enumerate’ (*note enumerate::).

   The ‘itemize’ environment uses the commands ‘\labelitemi’ through
‘\labelitemiv’ to produce the default label (note the convention of
lowercase roman numerals at the end of the command names that signify
the nesting level).  These are the default marks at each level.

  1. • (bullet, from ‘\textbullet’)
  2. -- (bold en-dash, from ‘\normalfont\bfseries\textendash’)
  3. * (asterisk, from ‘\textasteriskcentered’)
  4. .  (vertically centered dot, rendered here as a period, from
     ‘\textperiodcentered’)

   Change the labels with ‘\renewcommand’.  For instance, this makes the
first level use diamonds.

     \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\diamond$}

   The distance between the left margin of the enclosing environment and
the left margin of the ‘itemize’ list is determined by the parameters
‘\leftmargini’ through ‘\leftmarginvi’.  (This also uses the convention
of using lowercase roman numerals a the end of the command name to
denote the nesting level.)  The defaults are: ‘2.5em’ in level 1 (‘2em’
in two-column mode), ‘2.2em’ in level 2, ‘1.87em’ in level 3, and
‘1.7em’ in level 4, with smaller values for more deeply nested levels.

   For other major LaTeX labeled list environments, see *note
description:: and *note enumerate::.  The ‘itemize’, ‘enumerate’ and
‘description’ environment use the same list layout parameters.  For a
description, including the default values, and for information about
customizing list layout, see *note list::.  The package ‘enumitem’ is
useful for customizing lists.

   This example greatly reduces the margin space for outermost itemized
lists.

     \setlength{\leftmargini}{1.25em} % default 2.5em

   Especially for lists with short items, it may be desirable to elide
space between items.  Here is an example defining an ‘itemize*’
environment with no extra spacing between items, or between paragraphs
within a single item (‘\parskip’ is not list-specific, *note \parindent
& \parskip::):

     \newenvironment{itemize*}%
       {\begin{itemize}%
         \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}%
         \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}%
         \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}%
       }%

8.16 ‘list’
===========

Synopsis:

     \begin{list}{LABELING}{SPACING}
       \item[OPTIONAL LABEL OF FIRST ITEM] TEXT OF FIRST ITEM
       \item[OPTIONAL LABEL OF SECOND ITEM] TEXT OF SECOND ITEM
       ...
     \end{list}

   An environment for constructing lists.

   Note that this environment does not typically appear in the document
body.  Most lists created by LaTeX authors are the ones that come
standard: the ‘description’, ‘enumerate’, and ‘itemize’ environments
(*note description::, *note enumerate::, and *note itemize::).

   Instead, the ‘list’ environment is most often used in macros.  For
example, many standard LaTeX environments that do not immediately appear
to be lists are in fact constructed using ‘list’, including ‘quotation’,
‘quote’, and ‘center’ (*note quotation & quote::, *note center::).

   This uses the ‘list’ environment to define a new custom environment.

     \newcounter{namedlistcounter}  % number the items
     \newenvironment{named}
       {\begin{list}
          {Item~\Roman{namedlistcounter}.} % labeling
          {\usecounter{namedlistcounter}   % set counter
           \setlength{\leftmargin}{3.5em}} % set spacing
       }
       {\end{list}}

     \begin{named}
       \item Shows as ``Item~I.''
       \item[Special label.] Shows as ``Special label.''
       \item Shows as ``Item~II.''
     \end{named}

   The mandatory first argument LABELING specifies the default labeling
of list items.  It can contain text and LaTeX commands, as above where
it contains both ‘Item’ and ‘\Roman{...}’.  LaTeX forms the label by
putting the LABELING argument in a box of width ‘\labelwidth’.  If the
label is wider than that, the additional material extends to the right.
When making an instance of a ‘list’ you can override the default
labeling by giving ‘\item’ an optional argument by including square
braces and the text, as in the above ‘\item[Special label.]’; *note
\item::.

   The mandatory second argument SPACING has a list of commands.  This
list can be empty.  A command that can go in here is
‘\usecounter{COUNTERNAME}’ (*note \usecounter::).  Use this to tell
LaTeX to number the items using the given counter.  The counter will be
reset to zero each time LaTeX enters the environment, and the counter is
incremented by one each time LaTeX encounters an ‘\item’ that does not
have an optional argument.

   Another command that can go in SPACING is ‘\makelabel’, which
constructs the label box.  By default it puts the contents flush right.
Its only argument is the label, which it typesets in LR mode (*note
Modes::).  One example of changing its definition is that to the above
‘named’ example, before the definition of the environment add
‘\newcommand{\namedmakelabel}[1]{\textsc{#1}}’, and between the
‘\setlength’ command and the parenthesis that closes the SPACING
argument also add ‘\let\makelabel\namedmakelabel’.  Then the labels will
be typeset in small caps.  Similarly, changing the second code line to
‘\let\makelabel\fbox’ puts the labels inside a framed box.  Another
example of the ‘\makelabel’ command is below, in the definition of the
‘redlabel’ environment.

   Also often in SPACING are commands to redefine the spacing for the
list.  Below are the spacing parameters with their default values.
(Default values for derived environments such as ‘itemize’ can be
different than the values shown here.)  See also the figure that follows
the list.  Each is a length (*note Lengths::).  The vertical spaces are
normally rubber lengths, with ‘plus’ and ‘minus’ components, to give TeX
flexibility in setting the page.  Change each with a command such as
‘\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt plus1pt minus1pt}’.  For some effects these
lengths should be zero or negative.

‘\itemindent’
     Extra horizontal space indentation, beyond ‘leftmargin’, of the
     first line each item.  Its default value is ‘0pt’.

‘\itemsep’
     Vertical space between items, beyond the ‘\parsep’.  The defaults
     for the first three levels in LaTeX's ‘article’, ‘book’, and
     ‘report’ classes at 10 point size are: ‘4pt plus2pt minus1pt’,
     ‘\parsep’ (that is, ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’), and ‘\topsep’ (that
     is, ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’).  The defaults at 11 point are: ‘4.5pt
     plus2pt minus1pt’, ‘\parsep’ (that is, ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’), and
     ‘\topsep’ (that is, ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’).  The defaults at 12
     point are: ‘5pt plus2.5pt minus1pt’, ‘\parsep’ (that is, ‘2.5pt
     plus1pt minus1pt’), and ‘\topsep’ (that is, ‘2.5pt plus1pt
     minus1pt’).

‘\labelsep’
     Horizontal space between the label and text of an item.  The
     default for LaTeX's ‘article’, ‘book’, and ‘report’ classes is
     ‘0.5em’.

‘\labelwidth’
     Horizontal width.  The box containing the label is nominally this
     wide.  If ‘\makelabel’ returns text that is wider than this then
     the first line of the item will be indented to make room for this
     extra material.  If ‘\makelabel’ returns text of width less than or
     equal to ‘\labelwidth’ then LaTeX's default is that the label is
     typeset flush right in a box of this width.

     The left edge of the label box is
     ‘\leftmargin’+‘\itemindent’-‘\labelsep’-‘\labelwidth’ from the left
     margin of the enclosing environment.

     The default for LaTeX's ‘article’, ‘book’, and ‘report’ classes at
     the top level is ‘\leftmargini’-‘\labelsep’, (which is ‘2em’ in one
     column mode and ‘1.5em’ in two column mode).  At the second level
     it is ‘\leftmarginii’-‘\labelsep’, and at the third level it is
     ‘\leftmarginiii’-‘\labelsep’.  These definitions make the label's
     left edge coincide with the left margin of the enclosing
     environment.

‘\leftmargin’
     Horizontal space between the left margin of the enclosing
     environment (or the left margin of the page if this is a top-level
     list), and the left margin of this list.  It must be non-negative.

     In the standard LaTeX document classes, a top-level list has this
     set to the value of ‘\leftmargini’, while a list that is nested
     inside a top-level list has this margin set to ‘\leftmarginii’.
     More deeply nested lists get the values of ‘\leftmarginiii’ through
     ‘\leftmarginvi’.  (Nesting greater than level five generates the
     error message ‘Too deeply nested’.)

     The defaults for the first three levels in LaTeX's ‘article’,
     ‘book’, and ‘report’ classes are: ‘\leftmargini’ is ‘2.5em’ (in two
     column mode, ‘2em’), ‘\leftmarginii’ is ‘2.2em’, and
     ‘\leftmarginiii’ is ‘1.87em’.

‘\listparindent’
     Horizontal space of additional line indentation, beyond
     ‘\leftmargin’, for second and subsequent paragraphs within a list
     item.  A negative value makes this an "outdent".  Its default value
     is ‘0pt’.

‘\parsep’
     Vertical space between paragraphs within an item.  The defaults for
     the first three levels in LaTeX's ‘article’, ‘book’, and ‘report’
     classes at 10 point size are: ‘4pt plus2pt minus1pt’, ‘2pt plus1pt
     minus1pt’, and ‘0pt’.  The defaults at 11 point size are: ‘4.5pt
     plus2pt minus1pt’, ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’, and ‘0pt’.  The defaults
     at 12 point size are: ‘5pt plus2.5pt minus1pt’, ‘2.5pt plus1pt
     minus1pt’, and ‘0pt’.

‘\partopsep’
     Vertical space added, beyond ‘\topsep’+‘\parskip’, to the top and
     bottom of the entire environment if the list instance is preceded
     by a blank line.  (A blank line in the LaTeX source before the list
     changes spacing at both the top and bottom of the list; whether the
     line following the list is blank does not matter.)

     The defaults for the first three levels in LaTeX's ‘article’,
     ‘book’, and ‘report’ classes at 10 point size are: ‘2pt plus1
     minus1pt’, ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’, and ‘1pt plus0pt minus1pt’.  The
     defaults at 11 point are: ‘3pt plus1pt minus1pt’, ‘3pt plus1pt
     minus1pt’, and ‘1pt plus0pt minus1pt’).  The defaults at 12 point
     are: ‘3pt plus2pt minus3pt’, ‘3pt plus2pt minus2pt’, and ‘1pt
     plus0pt minus1pt’.

‘\rightmargin’
     Horizontal space between the right margin of the list and the right
     margin of the enclosing environment.  Its default value is ‘0pt’.
     It must be non-negative.

‘\topsep’
     Vertical space added to both the top and bottom of the list, in
     addition to ‘\parskip’ (*note \parindent & \parskip::).  The
     defaults for the first three levels in LaTeX's ‘article’, ‘book’,
     and ‘report’ classes at 10 point size are: ‘8pt plus2pt minus4pt’,
     ‘4pt plus2pt minus1pt’, and ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’.  The defaults
     at 11 point are: ‘9pt plus3pt minus5pt’, ‘4.5pt plus2pt minus1pt’,
     and ‘2pt plus1pt minus1pt’.  The defaults at 12 point are: ‘10pt
     plus4pt minus6pt’, ‘5pt plus2.5pt minus1pt’, and ‘2.5pt plus1pt
     minus1pt’.

   This shows the horizontal and vertical distances.

   The lengths shown are listed below.  The key relationship is that the
right edge of the bracket for H1 equals the right edge of the bracket
for H4, so that the left edge of the label box is at H3+H4-(H0+H1).

V0
     ‘\topsep’ + ‘\parskip’ if the list environment does not start a new
     paragraph, and ‘\topsep’+‘\parskip’+‘\partopsep’ if it does

V1
     ‘\parsep’

V2
     ‘\itemsep’+‘\parsep’

V3
     Same as V0.  (This space is affected by whether a blank line
     appears in the source above the environment; whether a blank line
     appears in the source below the environment does not matter.)

H0
     ‘\labelwidth’

H1
     ‘\labelsep’

H2
     ‘\listparindent’

H3
     ‘\leftmargin’

H4
     ‘\itemindent’

H5
     ‘\rightmargin’

   The list's left and right margins, shown above as H3 and H5, are with
respect to the ones provided by the surrounding environment, or with
respect to the page margins for a top-level list.  The line width used
for typesetting the list items is ‘\linewidth’ (*note Page layout
parameters::).  For instance, set the list's left margin to be one
quarter of the distance between the left and right margins of the
enclosing environment with ‘\setlength{\leftmargin}{0.25\linewidth}’.

   Page breaking in a list structure is controlled by the three
parameters below.  For each, the LaTeX default is ‘-\@lowpenalty’, that
is, ‘-51’.  Because it is negative, it somewhat encourages a page break
at each spot.  Change it with, e.g., ‘\@beginparpenalty=9999’; a value
of 10000 prohibits a page break.

‘\@beginparpenalty’
     The page breaking penalty for breaking before the list (default
     ‘-51’).

‘\@itempenalty’
     The page breaking penalty for breaking before a list item (default
     ‘-51’).

‘\@endparpenalty’
     The page breaking penalty for breaking after a list (default
     ‘-51’).

   The package ‘enumitem’ is useful for customizing lists.

   This example has the labels in red.  They are numbered, and the left
edge of the label lines up with the left edge of the item text.  *Note
\usecounter::.

     \usepackage{color}
     \newcounter{cnt}

          \setlength{\labelsep}{0.5em}
          \setlength{\leftmargin}{1.5em}
          \setlength{\itemindent}{0.5em} % equals \labelwidth+\labelsep

8.16.1 ‘\item’: An entry in a list
----------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \item text of item

or

     \item[OPTIONAL-LABEL] text of item

   An entry in a list.  The entries are prefixed by a label, whose
default depends on the list type.

   Because the optional label is surrounded by square brackets ‘[...]’,
if you have an item whose text starts with [, you have to hide the
bracket inside curly braces, as in: ‘\item {[} is an open square
bracket’; otherwise, LaTeX will think it marks the start of an optional
label.

   Similarly, if the item does have the optional label and you need a
close square bracket inside that label, you must hide it in the same
way: ‘\item[Close square bracket, {]}]’.  *Note LaTeX command syntax::.

   In this example the enumerate list has two items that use the default
label and one that uses the optional label.

     \begin{enumerate}
       \item Moe
       \item[sometimes] Shemp
       \item Larry
     \end{enumerate}

   The first item is labelled ‘1.’, the second item is labelled
‘sometimes’, and the third item is labelled ‘2.’.  Because of the
optional label in the second item, the third item is not labelled ‘3.’.

8.16.2 ‘trivlist’: A restricted form of ‘list’
----------------------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \begin{trivlist}
       ...
     \end{trivlist}

   A restricted version of the list environment, in which margins are
not indented and an ‘\item’ without an optional argument produces no
text.  It is most often used in macros, to define an environment where
the ‘\item’ command is part of the environment's definition.  For
instance, the ‘center’ environment is defined essentially like this:

     \newenvironment{center}
       {\begin{trivlist}\centering\item\relax}
       {\end{trivlist}}

   Using ‘trivlist’ in this way allows the macro to inherit some common
code: combining vertical space of two adjacent environments; detecting
whether the text following the environment should be considered a new
paragraph or a continuation of the previous one; adjusting the left and
right margins for possible nested list environments.

   Specifically, ‘trivlist’ uses the current values of the list
parameters (*note list::), except that ‘\parsep’ is set to the value of
‘\parskip’, and ‘\leftmargin’, ‘\labelwidth’, and ‘\itemindent’ are set
to zero.

   This example outputs the items as two paragraphs, except that (by
default) they have no paragraph indent and are vertically separated.

     \begin{trivlist}
     \item The \textit{Surprise} is not old; no one would call her old.
     \item She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.
     \end{trivlist}

8.18 ‘minipage’
===============

Synopses:

     \begin{minipage}{WIDTH}
       CONTENTS
     \end{minipage}

or

     \begin{minipage}[POSITION][HEIGHT][INNER-POS]{WIDTH}
       CONTENTS
     \end{minipage}

   Put CONTENTS into a box that is WIDTH wide.  This is like a small
version of a page; it can contain its own footnotes, itemized lists,
etc.  (There are some restrictions, including that it cannot have
floats.)  This box will not be broken across pages.  So ‘minipage’ is
similar to ‘\parbox’ (*note \parbox::) but here you can have paragraphs.

   This example will be 3 inches wide, and has two paragraphs.

     \begin{minipage}{3in}
       Stephen Kleene was a founder of the Theory of Computation.

       He was a student of Church, wrote three influential texts,
       was President of the Association for Symbolic Logic,
       and won the National Medal of Science.
     \end{minipage}

See below for a discussion of the paragraph indent inside a ‘minipage’.

   The required argument WIDTH is a rigid length (*note Lengths::).  It
gives the width of the box into which CONTENTS are typeset.

   There are three optional arguments, POSITION, HEIGHT, and INNER-POS.
You need not include all three.  For example, get the default POSITION
and set the HEIGHT with ‘\begin{minipage}[c][2.54cm]{\columnwidth}
CONTENTS \end{minipage}’.  (Get the natural height with an empty
argument, ‘[]’.)

   The optional argument POSITION governs how the ‘minipage’ vertically
aligns with the surrounding material.

‘c’
     (synonym ‘m’) Default.  Positions the ‘minipage’ so its vertical
     center lines up with the center of the adjacent text line.

‘t’
     Align the baseline of the top line in the ‘minipage’ with the
     baseline of the surrounding text (plain TeX's ‘\vtop’).

‘b’
     Align the baseline of the bottom line in the ‘minipage’ with the
     baseline of the surrounding text (plain TeX's ‘\vbox’).

   To see the effects of these, contrast running this

     ---\begin{minipage}[c]{0.25in}
       first\\ second\\ third
     \end{minipage}

with the results of changing ‘c’ to ‘b’ or ‘t’.

   The optional argument HEIGHT is a rigid length (*note Lengths::).  It
sets the height of the ‘minipage’.  You can enter any value larger than,
or equal to, or smaller than the ‘minipage’'s natural height and LaTeX
will not give an error or warning.  You can also set it to a height of
zero or a negative value.

   The final optional argument INNER-POS controls the placement of
CONTENTS inside the box.  These are the possible values are (the default
is the value of POSITION).

‘t’
     Place CONTENTS at the top of the box.

‘c’
     Place it in the vertical center.

‘b’
     Place it at the box bottom.

‘s’
     Stretch CONTENTS out vertically; it must contain vertically
     stretchable space.

   The INNER-POS argument makes sense when the HEIGHT option is set to a
value larger than the ‘minipage’'s natural height.  To see the effect of
the options, run this example with the various choices in place of ‘b’.

     Text before
     \begin{center}
       ---\begin{minipage}[c][3in][b]{0.25\textwidth}
            first\\ second\\ third
       \end{minipage}
     \end{center}
     Text after

   By default paragraphs are not indented in a ‘minipage’.  Change that
with a command such as ‘\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}’ at the start of
CONTENTS.

   Footnotes in a ‘minipage’ environment are handled in a way that is
particularly useful for putting footnotes in figures or tables.  A
‘\footnote’ or ‘\footnotetext’ command puts the footnote at the bottom
of the minipage instead of at the bottom of the page, and it uses the
‘\mpfootnote’ counter instead of the ordinary ‘footnote’ counter (*note
Counters::).

   This puts the footnote at the bottom of the table, not the bottom of
the page.

     \begin{center}           % center the minipage on the line
     \begin{minipage}{2.5in}
       \begin{center}         % center the table inside the minipage
         \begin{tabular}{ll}
           \textsc{Monarch}  &\textsc{Reign}             \\ \hline
           Elizabeth II      &63 years\footnote{to date} \\
           Victoria          &63 years                   \\
           George III        &59 years
         \end{tabular}
       \end{center}
     \end{minipage}
     \end{center}

   If you nest minipages then there is an oddness when using footnotes.
Footnotes appear at the bottom of the text ended by the next
‘\end{minipage}’ which may not be their logical place.

   This puts a table containing data side by side with a map graphic.
They are vertically centered.

8.19 ‘picture’
==============

Synopses:
     \begin{picture}(WIDTH,HEIGHT)
        PICTURE COMMAND
     \end{picture}

or

     \begin{picture}(WIDTH,HEIGHT)(XOFFSET,YOFFSET)
       PICTURE COMMAND
     \end{picture}

Where there may be any number of PICTURE COMMAND's.

   An environment to create simple pictures containing lines, arrows,
boxes, circles, and text.  This environment is not obsolete, but new
documents typically use much more powerful graphics creation systems,
such as TikZ, PSTricks, MetaPost, or Asymptote.  None of these are
covered in this document; see CTAN.

   To start, here's an example showing the parallelogram law for adding
vectors.

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
     \begin{picture}(6,6)      % picture box will be 6cm wide by 6cm tall
       \put(0,0){\vector(2,1){4}}  % for every 2 over this vector goes 1 up
         \put(2,1){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\ first leg}}
       \put(4,2){\vector(1,2){2}}
         \put(5,4){\makebox(0,0)[l]{\ second leg}}
       \put(0,0){\vector(1,1){6}}
         \put(3,3){\makebox(0,0)[r]{sum\ }}
     \end{picture}

   The ‘picture’ environment has one required argument, a pair of
positive real numbers (WIDTH,HEIGHT).  Multiply these by the value
‘\unitlength’ to get the nominal size of the output, i.e. the space that
LaTeX reserves on the output page.  This nominal size need not be how
large the picture really is; LaTeX will draw things from the picture
outside the picture's box.

   This environment also has an optional argument (XOFFSET,YOFFSET).  It
is used to shift the origin.  Unlike most optional arguments, this one
is not contained in square brackets.  As with the required argument, it
consists of a pair of two real numbers, but these may also be negative
or null.  Multiply these by ‘\unitlength’ to get the coordinates of the
point at the lower-left corner of the picture.

   For example, if ‘\unitlength’ has been set to ‘1mm’, the command

     \begin{picture}(100,200)(10,20)

produces a box of width 100 millimeters and height 200 millimeters.  The
picture's origin is the point (10mm,20mm) and so the lower-left corner
is there, and the upper-right corner is at (110mm,220mm).  When you
first draw a picture you typically omit the optional argument, leaving
the origin at the lower-left corner.  If you then want to modify your
picture by shifting everything, you can just add the appropriate
optional argument.

   Each PICTURE COMMAND tells LaTeX where to put something by providing
its position.  A “position” is a pair such as ‘(2.4,-5)’ giving the x-
and y-coordinates.  A “coordinate” is a not a length, it is a real
number (it may have a decimal point or a minus sign).  It specifies a
length in multiples of the unit length ‘\unitlength’, so if
‘\unitlength’ has been set to ‘1cm’, then the coordinate ‘2.54’
specifies a length of 2.54 centimeters.

   LaTeX's default for ‘\unitlength’ is ‘1pt’.  It is a rigid length
(*note Lengths::).  Change it with the ‘\setlength’ command (*note
\setlength::).  Make this change only outside of a ‘picture’
environment.

   The ‘picture’ environment supports using standard arithmetic
expressions as well as numbers.

   Coordinates are given with respect to an origin, which is by default
at the lower-left corner of the picture.  Note that when a position
appears as an argument, as with ‘\put(1,2){...}’, it is not enclosed in
braces since the parentheses serve to delimit the argument.  Also,
unlike in some computer graphics systems, larger y-coordinates are
further up the page, for example, y = 1 is _above_ y = 0.

   There are four ways to put things in a picture: ‘\put’, ‘\multiput’,
‘\qbezier’, and ‘\graphpaper’.  The most often used is ‘\put’.  This

     \put(11.3,-0.3){...}

places the object with its reference point at coordinates (11.3,-0.3).
The reference points for various objects will be described below.  The
‘\put’ command creates an “LR box” (*note Modes::).  Anything that can
go in an ‘\mbox’ (*note \mbox & \makebox::) can go in the text argument
of the ‘\put’ command.  The reference point will be the lower left
corner of the box.  In this picture

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
     ...\begin{picture}(1,1)
       \put(0,0){\line(1,0){1}}
       \put(0,0){\line(1,1){1}}
     \end{picture}

the three dots are just slightly left of the point of the angle formed
by the two lines.  (Also, ‘\line(1,1){1}’ does not call for a line of
length one; rather the line has a change in the x coordinate of 1.)

   The ‘\multiput’, ‘qbezier’, and ‘graphpaper’ commands are described
below.

   You can also use this environment to place arbitrary material at an
exact location.  For example:

     \usepackage{color,graphicx}  % in preamble
       ...
     \begin{center}
     \setlength{\unitlength}{\textwidth}
     \begin{picture}(1,1)      % leave space, \textwidth wide and tall
       \put(0,0){\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{desertedisland.jpg}}
       \put(0.25,0.35){\textcolor{red}{X Treasure here}}
     \end{picture}
     \end{center}

The red X will be precisely a quarter of the ‘\textwidth’ from the left
margin, and ‘0.35\textwidth’ up from the bottom of the picture.  Another
example of this usage is to put similar code in the page header to get
repeat material on each of a document's pages.

Synopsis:

   Draw a quadratic Bezier curve whose control points are given by the
three required arguments ‘(X1,Y1)’, ‘(X2,Y2)’, and ‘(X3,Y3)’.  That is,
the curve runs from (X1,Y1) to (X3,Y3), is quadratic, and is such that
the tangent line at (X1,Y1) passes through (X2,Y2), as does the tangent
line at (X3,Y3).

   This draws a curve from the coordinate (1,1) to (1,0).

     \qbezier(1,1)(1.25,0.75)(1,0)

The curve's tangent line at (1,1) contains (1.25,0.75), as does the
curve's tangent line at (1,0).

   The optional argument NUM gives the number of calculated intermediate
points.  The default is to draw a smooth curve whose maximum number of
points is ‘\qbeziermax’ (change this value with ‘\renewcommand’).

   This draws a rectangle with a wavy top, using ‘\qbezier’ for that
curve.

origin is ‘(X_INIT,Y_INIT)’.  Grid lines come every SPACING units (the
default is 10).  The grid extends X_DIMEN units to the right and Y_DIMEN
units up.  All arguments must be positive integers.

Synopsis:

     \line(X_RUN,Y_RISE){TRAVEL}

   Draw a line.  It slopes such that it vertically rises Y_RISE for
every horizontal X_RUN.  The TRAVEL is the total horizontal change--it
is not the length of the vector, it is the change in x.  In the special
case of vertical lines, where (X_RUN,Y_RISE)=(0,1), the TRAVEL gives the
change in y.

   This draws a line starting at coordinates (1,3).

     \put(1,3){\line(2,5){4}}

For every over 2, this line will go up 5.  Because TRAVEL specifies that
this goes over 4, it must go up 10.  Thus its endpoint is
(1,3)+(4,10)=(5,13).  In particular, note that TRAVEL=4 is not the
length of the line, it is the change in x.

   The arguments X_RUN and Y_RISE are integers that can be positive,
negative, or zero.  (If both are 0 then LaTeX treats the second as 1.)
With ‘\put(X_INIT,Y_INIT){\line(X_RUN,Y_RISE){TRAVEL}}’, if X_RUN is
negative then the line's ending point has a first coordinate that is
less than X_INIT.  If Y_RISE is negative then the line's ending point
has a second coordinate that is less than Y_INIT.

   If TRAVEL is negative then you get ‘LaTeX Error: Bad \line or \vector
argument.’

   Standard LaTeX can only draw lines with a limited range of slopes
because these lines are made by putting together line segments from
pre-made fonts.  The two numbers X_RUN and Y_RISE must have integer
values from −6 through 6.  Also, they must be relatively prime, so that
(X_RUN,Y_RISE) can be (2,1) but not (4,2) (if you choose the latter then
instead of lines you get sequences of arrowheads; the solution is to
switch to the former).  To get lines of arbitrary slope and plenty of
other shapes in a system like ‘picture’, see the package ‘pict2e’
(<https://ctan.org/pkg/pict2e>).  Another solution is to use a
full-featured graphics system such as TikZ, PSTricks, MetaPost, or
Asymptote.

Synopsis:

     \linethickness{DIM}

   Declares the thickness of subsequent horizontal and vertical lines in
a picture to be DIM, which must be a positive length (*note Lengths::).
It differs from ‘\thinlines’ and ‘\thicklines’ in that it does not
affect the thickness of slanted lines, circles, or ovals (*note

8.19.7 ‘\thinlines’
-------------------

Declaration to set the thickness of subsequent lines, circles, and ovals
in a picture environment to be 0.4pt.  This is the default thickness, so
this command is unnecessary unless the thickness has been changed with
either *note \linethickness:: or *note \thicklines::.

Declaration to set the thickness of subsequent lines, circles, and ovals

and *note \thinlines::.  This command is illustrated in the Trapezoidal
Rule example of *note \qbezier::.

8.19.9 ‘\circle’
----------------

Synopsis:

     \circle{DIAMETER}
     \circle*{DIAMETER}

   Produces a circle with a diameter as close as possible to the
specified one.  The ‘*’ form produces a filled-in circle.

   This draws a circle of radius 6, centered at ‘(5,7)’.

     \put(5,7){\circle{6}}

   The available radii for ‘\circle’ are, in points, the even numbers
from 2 to 20, inclusive.  For ‘\circle*’ they are all the integers from
1 to 15.

8.19.10 ‘\oval’
---------------

Synopsis:

     \oval(WIDTH,HEIGHT)
     \oval(WIDTH,HEIGHT)[PORTION]

   Produce a rectangle with rounded corners, hereinafter referred to as
an “oval”.  The optional argument PORTION allows you to produce only
half or a quarter of the oval.  For half an oval take PORTION to be one
of these.

‘t’
     top half
‘b’
     bottom half
‘r’
     right half
‘l’
     left half

   Produce only one quarter of the oval by setting PORTION to ‘tr’,
‘br’, ‘bl’, or ‘tl’.

   This draws the top half of an oval that is 3 wide and 7 tall.

     \put(5,7){\oval(3,7)[t]}

The (5,7) is the center of the entire oval, not just the center of the
top half.

   These shapes are not ellipses.  They are rectangles whose corners are
made with quarter circles.  These circles have a maximum radius of 20pt
(*note \circle:: for the sizes).  Thus large ovals are just frames with
a small amount of corner rounding.

8.19.11 ‘\shortstack’
---------------------

Synopsis:

     \shortstack[POSITION]{LINE 1 \\ ... }

   Produce a vertical stack of objects.

   This labels the y axis by writing the word ‘y’ above the word ‘axis’.

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
     \begin{picture}(5,2.5)(-0.75,0)
        \put(0,0){\vector(1,0){4}}   % x axis
        \put(0,0){\vector(0,1){2}}   % y
        \put(-0.2,2){\makebox(0,0)[r]{\shortstack[r]{$y$\\ axis}}}
     \end{picture}

For a short stack, the reference point is the lower left of the stack.
In the above example the ‘\makebox’ (*note \mbox & \makebox::) puts the
stack flush right in a zero width box so in total the short stack sits
slightly to the left of the y axis.

   The valid positions are:

‘r’
     Make objects flush right
‘l’
     Make objects flush left
‘c’
     Center objects (default)

   Separate objects into lines with ‘\\’.  These stacks are short in
that, unlike in a ‘tabular’ or ‘array’ environment, here the rows are
not spaced out to be of even baseline skips.  Thus, in
‘\shortstack{X\\o\\o\\X}’ the first and last rows are taller than the
middle two, and therefore the baseline skip between the two middle rows
is smaller than that between the third and last row.  You can adjust row
heights and depths either by putting in the usual interline spacing with
‘\shortstack{X\\ \strut o\\o\\X}’ (*note \strut::), or explicitly, via
an zero-width box ‘\shortstack{X \\ \rule{0pt}{12pt} o\\o\\X}’ or by
using ‘\\’'s optional argument ‘\shortstack{X\\[2pt] o\\o\\X}’.

   The ‘\shortstack’ command is also available outside the ‘picture’
environment.

8.19.12 ‘\vector’
-----------------

Synopsis:

     \vector(X_RUN,Y_RISE){TRAVEL}

   Draw a line ending in an arrow.  The slope of that line is: it
vertically rises Y_RISE for every horizontal X_RUN.  The TRAVEL is the
total horizontal change--it is not the length of the vector, it is the
change in x.  In the special case of vertical vectors, if
(X_RUN,Y_RISE)=(0,1), then TRAVEL gives the change in y.

   For an example see *note picture::.

   For elaboration on X_RUN and Y_RISE see *note \line::.  As there, the
values of X_RUN and Y_RISE are limited.  For ‘\vector’ you must chooses
integers between −4 and 4, inclusive.  Also, the two you choose must be
relatively prime.  Thus, ‘\vector(2,1){4}’ is acceptable but
‘\vector(4,2){4}’ is not (if you use the latter then you get a sequence
of arrowheads).

----------------------------

Synopsis:

     \makebox(REC-WIDTH,REC-HEIGHT){TEXT}
     \makebox(REC-WIDTH,REC-HEIGHT)[POSITION]{TEXT}

   Make a box to hold TEXT.  This command fits with the ‘picture’
environment, although you can use it outside of there, because REC-WIDTH
and REC-HEIGHT are numbers specifying distances in terms of the
‘\unitlength’ (*note picture::).  This command is similar to the normal
‘\makebox’ command (*note \mbox & \makebox::) except here that you must
specify the width and height.  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).

   This makes a box of length 3.5 times ‘\unitlength’ and height 4 times
‘\unitlength’.

     \put(1,2){\makebox(3.5,4){...}}

   The optional argument ‘POSITION’ specifies where in the box the TEXT
appears.  The default is to center it, both horizontally and vertically.
To place it somewhere else, use a string with one or two of these
letters.

‘t’
     Puts TEXT the top of the box.

‘b’
     Put TEXT at the bottom.

‘l’
     Put TEXT on the left.

‘r’
     Put TEXT on the right.

-----------------------------

Synopsis:

     \framebox(REC-WIDTH,REC-HEIGHT){TEXT}
     \framebox(REC-WIDTH,REC-HEIGHT)[POSITION]{TEXT}

   This is the same as *note \makebox (picture):: except that it puts a
frame around the outside of the box that it creates.  The reference
point is the bottom left corner of the frame.  This command fits with
the ‘picture’ environment, although you can use it outside of there,
because lengths are numbers specifying the distance in terms of the
‘\unitlength’ (*note picture::).  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).

   This example creates a frame 2.5 inches by 3 inches and puts the text
in the center.

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1in}
     \framebox(2.5,3){test text}

   The required arguments are that the rectangle has overall width
RECT-WIDTH units and height RECT-HEIGHT units.

   The optional argument POSITION specifies the position of TEXT; see
*note \makebox (picture):: for the values that it can take.

   The rule has thickness ‘\fboxrule’ and there is a blank space
‘\fboxsep’ between the frame and the contents of the box.

   For this command, you must specify the WIDTH and HEIGHT.  If you want
to just put a frame around some contents whose dimension is determined
in some other way then either use ‘\fbox’ (*note \fbox & \framebox::) or
‘\frame’ (*note \frame::).

8.19.15 ‘\frame’
----------------

Synopsis:

     \frame{CONTENTS}

   Puts a rectangular frame around CONTENTS.  The reference point is the
bottom left corner of the frame.  In contrast to ‘\framebox’ (*note
\framebox (picture)::), this command puts no extra space between the
frame and the object.  It is fragile (*note \protect::).

8.19.16 ‘\dashbox’
------------------

Synopsis:

     \dashbox{DASH-LEN}(RECT-WIDTH,RECT-HEIGHT){TEXT}
     \dashbox{DASH-LEN}(RECT-WIDTH,RECT-HEIGHT)[POSITION]{TEXT}

   Create a dashed rectangle around TEXT.  This command fits with the
‘picture’ environment, although you can use it outside of there, because
lengths are numbers specifying the distance in terms of the
‘\unitlength’ (*note picture::).

   The required arguments are: dashes are DASH-LEN units long, with the
same length gap, and the rectangle has overall width RECT-WIDTH units
and height RECT-HEIGHT units.

   The optional argument POSITION specifies the position of TEXT; see
*note \makebox (picture):: for the values that it can take.

   This shows that you can use non-integer value for DASH-LEN.

     \put(0,0){\dashbox{0.1}(5,0.5){My hovercraft is full of eels.}}

Each dash will be ‘0.1\unitlength’ long, the box's width is
‘5\unitlength’ and its height is ‘0.5\unitlength’.

   As in that example, a dashed box looks best when RECT-WIDTH and
RECT-HEIGHT are multiples of the DASH-LEN.

8.20 ‘quotation’ & ‘quote’

     \begin{quotation}
       TEXT

or

     \begin{quote}
       TEXT
     \end{quote}

   Include a quotation.  Both environments indent margins on both sides
by ‘\leftmargin’ and the text is right-justified.

   They differ in how they treat paragraphs.  In the ‘quotation’
environment, paragraphs are indented by 1.5em and the space between
paragraphs is small, ‘0pt plus 1pt’.  In the ‘quote’ environment,
paragraphs are not indented and there is vertical space between
paragraphs (it is the rubber length ‘\parsep’).

     \begin{quotation} \small\it

8.21 ‘tabbing’
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{tabbing}
     ROW1COL1 \= ROW1COL2 ...  \\
     ROW2COL1 \> ROW2COL2 ...  \\
     ...
     \end{tabbing}

   Align text in columns, by setting tab stops and tabbing to them much
as was done on a typewriter.  This is less often used than the
environments ‘tabular’ (*note tabular::) or ‘array’ (*note array::)
because in those the width of each column need not be constant and need
not be known in advance.

   This example has a first line where the tab stops are set to explicit
widths, ended by a ‘\kill’ command (which is described below):

     \begin{tabbing}
     \hspace{1.2in}\=\hspace{1in}\=\kill
     Ship                \>Guns             \>Year    \\
     \textit{Sophie}     \>14               \>1800    \\
     \textit{Polychrest} \>24               \>1803    \\
     \textit{Lively}     \>38               \>1804    \\
     \textit{Surprise}   \>28               \>1805    \\
     \end{tabbing}

   Both the ‘tabbing’ environment and the more widely-used ‘tabular’
environment put text in columns.  The most important distinction is that
in ‘tabular’ the width of columns is determined automatically by LaTeX,
while in ‘tabbing’ the user sets the tab stops.  Another distinction is
that ‘tabular’ generates a box, but ‘tabbing’ can be broken across
pages.  Finally, while ‘tabular’ can be used in any mode, ‘tabbing’ can
be used only in paragraph mode and it always starts a new paragraph,
without indentation.

   Moreover, as shown in the example above, there is no need to use the
starred form of the ‘\hspace’ command at the beginning of a tabbed row.
The right margin of the ‘tabbing’ environment is the end of line, so
that the width of the environment is ‘\linewidth’.

   The ‘tabbing’ environment contains a sequence of “tabbed rows”.  The
first tabbed row begins immediately after ‘\begin{tabbing}’ and each row
ends with ‘\\’ or ‘\kill’.  The last row may omit the ‘\\’ and end with
just ‘\end{tabbing}’.

   At any point the ‘tabbing’ environment has a “current tab stop
pattern”, a sequence of N > 0 tab stops, numbered 0, 1, etc.  These
create N corresponding columns.  Tab stop 0 is always the left margin,
defined by the enclosing environment.  Tab stop number I is set if it is
assigned a horizontal position on the page.  Tab stop number I can only
be set if all the stops 0, ..., i-1 have already been set; normally
later stops are to the right of earlier ones.

   By default any text typeset in a ‘tabbing’ environment is typeset
ragged right and left-aligned on the current tab stop.  Typesetting is
done in LR mode (*note Modes::).

   The following commands can be used inside a ‘tabbing’ environment.
They are all fragile (*note \protect::).

‘\\ (tabbing)’
     End a tabbed line and typeset it.

‘\= (tabbing)’
     Sets a tab stop at the current position.

‘\> (tabbing)’
     Advances to the next tab stop.

‘\<’
     Put following text to the left of the local margin (without
     changing the margin).  Can only be used at the start of the line.

‘\+’
     Moves the left margin of the next and all the following commands
     one tab stop to the right, beginning tabbed line if necessary.

‘\-’
     Moves the left margin of the next and all the following commands
     one tab stop to the left, beginning tabbed line if necessary.

‘\' (tabbing)’
     Moves everything that you have typed so far in the current column,
     i.e., everything from the most recent ‘\>’, ‘\<’, ‘\'’, ‘\\’, or
     ‘\kill’ command, to the previous column and aligned to the right,
     flush against the current column's tab stop.

‘\` (tabbing)’
     Allows you to put text flush right against any tab stop, including
     tab stop 0.  However, it can't move text to the right of the last
     column because there's no tab stop there.  The ‘\`’ command moves
     all the text that follows it, up to the ‘\\’ or ‘\end{tabbing}’
     command that ends the line, to the right margin of the ‘tabbing’
     environment.  There must be no ‘\>’ or ‘\'’ command between the
     ‘\`’ and the ‘\\’ or ‘\end{tabbing}’ command that ends the line.

‘\a (tabbing)’
     In a ‘tabbing’ environment, the commands ‘\=’, ‘\'’ and ‘\`’ do not
     produce accents as usual (*note Accents::).  Instead, use the
     commands ‘\a=’, ‘\a'’ and ‘\a`’.

‘\kill’
     Sets tab stops without producing text.  Works just like ‘\\’ except
     that it throws away the current line instead of producing output
     for it.  Any ‘\=’, ‘\+’ or ‘\-’ commands in that line remain in
     effect.

‘\poptabs’
     Restores the tab stop positions saved by the last ‘\pushtabs’.

‘\pushtabs’
     Saves all current tab stop positions.  Useful for temporarily
     changing tab stop positions in the middle of a ‘tabbing’
     environment.

‘\tabbingsep’
     Distance of the text moved by ‘\'’ to left of current tab stop.

   This example typesets a Pascal function:

     \begin{tabbing}
     function \= fact(n : integer) : integer;\\
              \> begin \= \+ \\
                    \> if \= n > 1 then \+ \\
                             fact := n * fact(n-1) \- \\
                       else \+ \\
                             fact := 1; \-\- \\
                 end;\\
     \end{tabbing}

The output looks like this.

     function fact(n : integer) : integer;
              begin
                    if n > 1 then
                       fact := n * fact(n-1);
                    else
                       fact := 1;
              end;

This example is just for illustration of the environment.  To actually
typeset computer code in typewriter like this, a verbatim environment
(*note verbatim::) would normally be best.  For pretty-printed code,
there are quite a few packages, including ‘algorithm2e’, ‘fancyvrb’,
‘listings’, and ‘minted’.

       \caption[LOFTITLE]{TITLE}  % optional
       \label{LABEL}              % also optional
     \end{table}

   A class of floats (*note Floats::).  They cannot be split across
pages and so they are not typeset in sequence with the normal text but
instead are floated to a convenient place, such as the top of a
following page.

   This example ‘table’ environment contains a ‘tabular’

     \begin{table}
       \centering\small
       \begin{tabular}{ll}
         \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{Author}}
           &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{Piece}}  \\ \hline
         Bach            &Cello Suite Number 1  \\
         Beethoven       &Cello Sonata Number 3 \\
         Brahms          &Cello Sonata Number 1
       \end{tabular}
       \caption{Top cello pieces}
       \label{tab:cello}
     \end{table}

but you can put many different kinds of content in a ‘table’: the TABLE
BODY may contain text, LaTeX commands, graphics, etc.  It is typeset in
a ‘parbox’ of width ‘\textwidth’.

   For the possible values of PLACEMENT and their effect on the float
placement algorithm, see *note Floats::.

   The label is optional; it is used for cross references (*note Cross
references::).  The ‘\caption’ command is also optional.  It specifies
caption text TITLE for the table (*note \caption::).  By default it is
numbered.  If its optional LOTTITLE is present then that text is used in
the list of tables instead of TITLE (*note Table of contents etc.::).

   In this example the table and caption will float to the bottom of a
page, unless it is pushed to a float page at the end.

     \begin{table}[b]

       \begin{tabular}{r|p{2in}} \hline

Synopsis:

     \begin{tabular}[POS]{COLS}
       COLUMN 1 ENTRY  &COLUMN 2 ENTRY  ...  &COLUMN N ENTRY \\
       ...
     \end{tabular}

or

     \begin{tabular*}{WIDTH}[POS]{COLS}
       COLUMN 1 ENTRY  &COLUMN 2 ENTRY  ...  &COLUMN N ENTRY \\
       ...
     \end{tabular*}

   Produce a table, a box consisting of a sequence of horizontal rows.
Each row consists of items that are aligned vertically in columns.  This
illustrates many of the features.

     \begin{tabular}{l|l}
       \textit{Player name}  &\textit{Career home runs}  \\
       \hline
       Hank Aaron  &755 \\
       Babe Ruth   &714
     \end{tabular}

The output will have two left-aligned columns with a vertical bar
between them.  This is specified in ‘tabular’'s argument ‘{l|l}’.  Put
the entries into different columns by separating them with an ampersand,
‘&’.  The end of each row is marked with a double backslash, ‘\\’.  Put
a horizontal rule below a row, after a double backslash, with ‘\hline’.
After the last row the ‘\\’ is optional, unless an ‘\hline’ command
follows to put a rule below the table.

   The required and optional arguments to ‘tabular’ consist of:

POS
     Optional.  Specifies the table's vertical position.  The default is
     to align the table so its vertical center matches the baseline of
     the surrounding text.  There are two other possible alignments: ‘t’
     aligns the table so its top row matches the baseline of the
     surrounding text, and ‘b’ aligns on the bottom row.

     This only has an effect if there is other text.  In the common case
     of a ‘tabular’ alone in a ‘center’ environment this option makes no
     difference.

COLS
     Required.  Specifies the formatting of columns.  It consists of a
     sequence of the following specifiers, corresponding to the types of
     column and intercolumn material.

     ‘l’
          A column of left-aligned items.

     ‘r’
          A column of right-aligned items.

     ‘c’
          A column of centered items.

     ‘|’
          A vertical line the full height and depth of the environment.

     ‘@{TEXT OR SPACE}’
          Insert TEXT OR SPACE at this location in every row.  The TEXT
          OR SPACE material is typeset in LR mode.  This text is fragile
          (*note \protect::).

          If between two column specifiers there is no @-expression then
          LaTeX's ‘book’, ‘article’, and ‘report’ classes will put on
          either side of each column a space of width ‘\tabcolsep’,
          which by default is 6pt.  That is, by default adjacent columns
          are separated by 12pt (so ‘\tabcolsep’ is misleadingly named
          since it is only half of the separation between tabular
          columns).  In addition, a space of ‘\tabcolsep’ also comes
          before the first column and after the final column, unless you
          put a ‘@{...}’ there.

          If you override the default and use an @-expression then LaTeX
          does not insert ‘\tabcolsep’ so you must insert any desired
          space yourself, as in ‘@{\hspace{1em}}’.

          An empty expression ‘@{}’ will eliminate the space.  In
          particular, sometimes you want to eliminate the space before
          the first column or after the last one, as in the example
          below where the tabular lines need to lie on the left margin.

               \begin{flushleft}
                 \begin{tabular}{@{}l}
                   ...
                 \end{tabular}
               \end{flushleft}

          The next example shows text, a decimal point between the
          columns, arranged so the numbers in the table are aligned on
          it.

               \begin{tabular}{r@{$.$}l}
                 $3$ &$14$  \\
                 $9$ &$80665$
               \end{tabular}

          An ‘\extracolsep{WD}’ command in an @-expression causes an
          extra space of width WD to appear to the left of all
          subsequent columns, until countermanded by another
          ‘\extracolsep’.  Unlike ordinary intercolumn space, this extra
          space is not suppressed by an @-expression.  An ‘\extracolsep’
          command can be used only in an @-expression in the ‘cols’
          argument.  Below, LaTeX inserts the right amount of
          intercolumn space to make the entire table 4 inches wide.

               \begin{tabular*}{4in}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}l}
                 Seven times down, eight times up \ldots
                 &such is life!
               \end{tabular*}

          To insert commands that are automatically executed before a
          given column, load the ‘array’ package and use the ‘>{...}’
          specifier.

     ‘p{WD}’
          Each item in the column is typeset in a parbox of width WD, as
          if it were the argument of a ‘\parbox[t]{wd}{...}’ command.

          A line break double backslash ‘\\’ may not appear in the item,
          except inside an environment like ‘minipage’, ‘array’, or
          ‘tabular’, or inside an explicit ‘\parbox’, or in the scope of
          a ‘\centering’, ‘\raggedright’, or ‘\raggedleft’ declaration
          (when used in a ‘p’-column element these declarations must
          appear inside braces, as with ‘{\centering .. \\ ..}’).
          Otherwise LaTeX will misinterpret the double backslash as
          ending the tabular row.  Instead, to get a line break in there
          use ‘\newline’ (*note \newline::).

     ‘*{NUM}{COLS}’
          Equivalent to NUM copies of COLS, where NUM is a positive
          integer and COLS is a list of specifiers.  Thus the specifier
          ‘\begin{tabular}{|*{3}{l|r}|}’ is equivalent to the specifier
          ‘\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|rl|r|}’.  Note that COLS may contain
          another ‘*’-expression.

WIDTH
     Required for ‘tabular*’, not allowed for ‘tabular’.  Specifies the
     width of the ‘tabular*’ environment.  The space between columns
     should be rubber, as with ‘@{\extracolsep{\fill}}’, to allow the
     table to stretch or shrink to make the specified width, or else you
     are likely to get the ‘Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) in alignment
     ...’ warning.

   Parameters that control formatting:

‘\arrayrulewidth’
     A length that is the thickness of the rule created by ‘|’,
     ‘\hline’, and ‘\vline’ in the ‘tabular’ and ‘array’ environments.
     The default is ‘.4pt’.  Change it as in
     ‘\setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{0.8pt}’.

‘\arraystretch’
     A factor by which the spacing between rows in the ‘tabular’ and
     ‘array’ environments is multiplied.  The default is ‘1’, for no
     scaling.  Change it as ‘\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}’.

‘\doublerulesep’
     A length that is the distance between the vertical rules produced
     by the ‘||’ specifier.  The default is ‘2pt’.

‘\tabcolsep’
     A length that is half of the space between columns.  The default is
     ‘6pt’.  Change it with ‘\setlength’.

   The following commands can be used inside the body of a ‘tabular’
environment, the first two inside an entry and the second two between
lines:

* Menu:

* \multicolumn::        Make an item spanning several columns.
* \vline::              Draw a vertical line.
* \cline::              Draw a horizontal line spanning some columns.
* \hline::              Draw a horizontal line spanning all columns.

8.23.1 ‘\multicolumn’
---------------------

Synopsis:

     \multicolumn{NUMCOLS}{COLS}{TEXT}

   Make an ‘array’ or ‘tabular’ entry that spans several columns.  The
first argument NUMCOLS gives the number of columns to span.  The second
argument COLS specifies the formatting of the entry, with ‘c’ for
centered, ‘l’ for flush left, or ‘r’ for flush right.  The third
argument TEXT gives the contents of that entry.

   In this example, in the first row, the second and third columns are
spanned by the single heading ‘Name’.

     \begin{tabular}{lccl}
       \textit{ID}       &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Name}} &\textit{Age} \\
       \hline
       978-0-393-03701-2 &O'Brian &Patrick                  &55           \\
         ...
     \end{tabular}

   What counts as a column is: the column format specifier for the
‘array’ or ‘tabular’ environment is broken into parts, where each part
(except the first) begins with ‘l’, ‘c’, ‘r’, or ‘p’.  So from
‘\begin{tabular}{|r|ccp{1.5in}|}’ the parts are ‘|r|’, ‘c’, ‘c’,
and ‘p{1.5in}|’.

   The COLS argument overrides the ‘array’ or ‘tabular’ environment's
intercolumn area default adjoining this multicolumn entry.  To affect
that area, this argument can contain vertical bars ‘|’ indicating the
placement of vertical rules, and ‘@{...}’ expressions.  Thus if COLS is
‘|c|’ then this multicolumn entry will be centered and a vertical rule
will come in the intercolumn area before it and after it.  This table
details the exact behavior.

     \begin{tabular}{|cc|c|c|}
       \multicolumn{1}{r}{w}       % entry one
         &\multicolumn{1}{|r|}{x}  % entry two
         &\multicolumn{1}{|r}{y}   % entry three
         &z                        % entry four
     \end{tabular}

Before the first entry the output will not have a vertical rule because
the ‘\multicolumn’ has the COLS specifier ‘r’ with no initial vertical
bar.  Between entry one and entry two there will be a vertical rule;
although the first COLS does not have an ending vertical bar, the second
COLS does have a starting one.  Between entry two and entry three there
is a single vertical rule; despite that the COLS in both of the
surrounding ‘multicolumn’'s call for a vertical rule, you only get one
rule.  Between entry three and entry four there is no vertical rule; the
default calls for one but the COLS in the entry three ‘\multicolumn’
leaves it out, and that takes precedence.  Finally, following entry four
there is a vertical rule because of the default.

   The number of spanned columns NUMCOLS can be 1.  Besides giving the
ability to change the horizontal alignment, this also is useful to
override for one row the ‘tabular’ definition's default intercolumn area
specification, including the placement of vertical rules.

   In the example below, in the ‘tabular’ definition the first column is
specified to default to left justified but in the first row the entry is
centered with ‘\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}’.  Also in the first
row, the second and third columns are spanned by a single entry with
‘\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}}’, overriding the specification to
center those two columns on the page range en-dash.

     \begin{tabular}{l|r@{--}l}
       \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}
         &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}} \\ \hline
       Baroque          &1600           &1760         \\
       Classical        &1730           &1820         \\
       Romantic         &1780           &1910         \\
       Impressionistic  &1875           &1925
     \end{tabular}

Although the ‘tabular’ specification by default puts a vertical rule
between the first and second columns, no such vertical rule appears in
the first row here.  That's because there is no vertical bar in the COLS
part of the first row's first ‘\multicolumn’ command.

8.23.2 ‘\vline’
---------------

Draw a vertical line in a ‘tabular’ or ‘array’ environment extending the
full height and depth of an entry's row.  Can also be used in an
@-expression, although its synonym vertical bar ‘|’ is more common.
This command is rarely used in the body of a table; typically a table's
vertical lines are specified in ‘tabular’'s COLS argument and overridden
as needed with ‘\multicolumn’ (*note tabular::).

   The example below illustrates some pitfalls.  In the first row's
second entry the ‘\hfill’ moves the ‘\vline’ to the left edge of the
cell.  But that is different than putting it halfway between the two
columns, so between the first and second columns there are two vertical
rules, with the one from the ‘{c|cc}’ specifier coming before the one
produced by the ‘\vline\hfill’.  In contrast, the first row's third
entry shows the usual way to put a vertical bar between two columns.  In
the second row, the ‘ghi’ is the widest entry in its column so in the
‘\vline\hfill’ the ‘\hfill’ has no effect and the vertical line in that
entry appears immediately next to the ‘g’, with no whitespace.

     \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
       x   &\vline\hfill y   &\multicolumn{1}{|r}{z} \\ % row 1
       abc &def &\vline\hfill ghi                       % row 2
     \end{tabular}

8.23.3 ‘\cline’
---------------

Synopsis:

     \cline{I-J}

   In an ‘array’ or ‘tabular’ environment, draw a horizontal rule
beginning in column I and ending in column J.  The dash, ‘-’, must
appear in the mandatory argument.  To span a single column use the
number twice, as with ‘\cline{2-2}’.

   This example puts two horizontal lines between the first and second
rows, one line in the first column only, and the other spanning the
third and fourth columns.  The two lines are side-by-side, at the same
height.

     \begin{tabular}{llrr}
       a &b &c &d \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-4}
       e &f &g &h

8.23.4 ‘\hline’
---------------

Draw a horizontal line the width of the enclosing ‘tabular’ or ‘array’
environment.  It's most commonly used to draw a line at the top, bottom,
and between the rows of a table.

   In this example the top of the table has two horizontal rules, one
above the other, that span both columns.  The bottom of the table has a
single rule spanning both columns.  Because of the ‘\hline’, the
‘tabular’ second row's line ending double backslash ‘\\’ is required.

     \begin{tabular}{ll} \hline\hline
       Baseball   &Red Sox  \\
       Basketball &Celtics  \\ \hline

======================

Synopsis:

     \begin{thebibliography}{WIDEST-LABEL}
       \bibitem[LABEL]{CITE_KEY}
       ...
     \end{thebibliography}

   Produce a bibliography or reference list.  There are two ways to
produce bibliographic lists.  This environment is suitable when you have
only a few references and can maintain the list by hand.  *Note Using
BibTeX::, for a more sophisticated approach.

   This shows the environment with two entries.

     This work is based on \cite{latexdps}.
     Together they are \cite{latexdps, texbook}.
       ...
     \begin{thebibliography}{9}
     \bibitem{latexdps}
       Leslie Lamport.
       \textit{\LaTeX{}: a document preparation system}.
       Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1993.
     \bibitem{texbook}
       Donald Ervin Knuth.
       \textit{The \TeX book}.
       Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1983.
     \end{thebibliography}

This styles the first reference as ‘[1] Leslie ...’, and so that ‘...
based on \cite{latexdps}’ produces the matching ‘... based on [1]’.  The
second ‘\cite’ produces ‘[1, 2]’.  You must compile the document twice
to resolve these references.

   The mandatory argument WIDEST-LABEL is text that, when typeset, is as
wide as the widest item label produced by the ‘\bibitem’ commands.  The
tradition is to use ‘9’ for bibliographies with less than 10 references,
‘99’ for ones with less than 100, etc.

   The bibliographic list is headed by a title such as ‘Bibliography’.
To change it there are two cases.  In the ‘book’ and ‘report’ classes,
where the top level sectioning is ‘\chapter’ and the default title is
‘Bibliography’, that title is in the macro ‘\bibname’.  For ‘article’,
where the class's top level sectioning is ‘\section’ and the default is
‘References’, the title is in macro ‘\refname’.  Change it by redefining
the command, as with ‘\renewcommand{\refname}{Cited references}’, after
‘\begin{document}’.

   Language support packages such as ‘babel’ will automatically redefine
‘\refname’ or ‘\bibname’ to fit the selected language.

8.24.1 ‘\bibitem’
-----------------

Synopsis:

     \bibitem{CITE_KEY}

or

     \bibitem[LABEL]{CITE_KEY}

   Generate an entry labeled by default by a number generated using the
‘enumi’ counter.  The “citation key” CITE_KEY can be any string of
letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols (but not comma).

   *Note thebibliography::, for an example.

   When provided, the optional LABEL becomes the entry label and the
‘enumi’ counter is not incremented.  With this

     \begin{thebibliography}
     \bibitem[Lamport 1993]{latexdps}
       Leslie Lamport.
       \textit{\LaTeX{}: a document preparation system}.
       Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1993.
     \bibitem{texbook}
       Donald Ervin Knuth.
       \textit{The \TeX book}.
       Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1983.
     \end{thebibliography}

the first entry will be styled as ‘[Lamport 1993] Leslie ...’ (The
amount of horizontal space that LaTeX leaves for the label depends on
the WIDEST-LABEL argument of the ‘thebibliography’ environment; see
*note thebibliography::.)  Similarly, ‘... based on \cite{latexdps}’
will produce ‘... based on [Lamport 1994]’.

   If you mix ‘\bibitem’ entries having a LABEL with those that do not
then LaTeX will number the unlabelled ones sequentially.  In the example
above the ‘texbook’ entry will appear as ‘[1] Donald ...’, despite that
it is the second entry.

   If you use the same CITE_KEY twice then you get ‘LaTeX Warning: There
were multiply-defined labels’.

   Under the hood, LaTeX remembers the CITE_KEY and LABEL information
because ‘\bibitem’ writes it to the auxiliary file ‘JOBNAME.aux’ (*note
Jobname::).  For instance, the above example causes the two
‘\bibcite{latexdps}{Lamport, 1993}’ and ‘\bibcite{texbook}{1}’ to appear
in that file.  The ‘.aux’ file is read by the ‘\begin{document}’ command
and then the information is available for ‘\cite’ commands.  This
explains why you need to run LaTeX twice to resolve references: once to
write it out and once to read it in.

   Because of this two-pass algorithm, when you add a ‘\bibitem’ or
change its CITE_KEY you may get ‘LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have
changed. Rerun to get cross-references right’.  Fix it by recompiling.

     \end{thebibliography}

produces output like ‘... source is [1]’.  You can change the appearance
of the citation and of the reference by using bibliography styles if you
generate automatically the ‘thebibliography’ environment.  More
information in *note Using BibTeX::.

   The optional argument SUBCITE is appended to the citation.  For
example, ‘See 14.3 in \cite[p.~314]{texbook}’ might produce ‘See 14.3 in
[1, p. 314]’.

   In addition to what appears in the output, ‘\cite’ writes information
to the auxiliary file ‘JOBNAME.aux’ (*note Jobname::).  For instance,
‘\cite{latexdps}’ writes ‘\citation{latexdps}’ to that file.  This
information is used by BibTeX to include in your reference list only
those works that you have actually cited; see *note \nocite:: also.

   If KEYS is not in your bibliography information then you get ‘LaTeX
Warning: There were undefined references’, and in the output the
citation shows as a boldface question mark between square brackets.
There are two possible causes.  If you have mistyped something, as in
‘\cite{texbok}’ then you need to correct the spelling.  On the other
hand, if you have just added or modified the bibliographic information
and so changed the ‘.aux’ file (*note \bibitem::) then the fix may be to
run LaTeX again.

8.24.4 Using BibTeX
-------------------

As described in ‘thebibliography’ (*note thebibliography::), a
sophisticated approach to managing bibliographies is provided by the
BibTeX program.  This is only an introduction; see the full
documentation on CTAN (*note CTAN::).

   With BibTeX, you don't use the ‘thebibliography’ environment directly
(*note thebibliography::).  Instead, include these lines:

     \bibliographystyle{BIBSTYLE}
     \bibliography{BIBFILE1, BIBFILE2, ...}

The BIBSTYLE refers to a file ‘BIBSTYLE.bst’, which defines how your
citations will look.  The standard BIBSTYLE's distributed with BibTeX
are:

‘alpha’
     Labels are formed from name of author and year of publication.  The
     bibliographic items are sorted alphabetically.
‘plain’
     Labels are integers.  Sort the bibliographic items alphabetically.
‘unsrt’
     Like ‘plain’, but entries are in order of citation.
‘abbrv’
     Like ‘plain’, but more compact labels.

Many, many other BibTeX style files exist, tailored to the demands of
various publications.  See the CTAN topic
<https://ctan.org/topic/bibtex-sty>.

   The ‘\bibliography’ command is what actually produces the
bibliography.  Its argument is a comma-separated list, referring to
files named ‘BIBFILE1.bib’, ‘BIBFILE2.bib’, ... These contain your
database in BibTeX format.  This shows a typical couple of entries in
that format.

     @book{texbook,
       title     = {The {{\TeX}}book},
       author    = {D.E. Knuth},
       isbn      = {0201134489},
       series    = {Computers \& typesetting},
       year      = {1983},
       publisher = {Addison-Wesley}
     }
     @book{sexbook,
         author    = {W.H. Masters and V.E. Johnson},
         title     = {Human Sexual Response},
         year      = {1966},
         publisher = {Bantam Books}
     }

   Only the bibliographic entries referred to via ‘\cite’ and ‘\nocite’
will be listed in the document's bibliography.  Thus you can keep all
your sources together in one file, or a small number of files, and rely
on BibTeX to include in this document only those that you used.

   With BibTeX, the KEYS argument to ‘\nocite’ can also be the single
character ‘*’.  This means to implicitly cite all entries from all given
bibliographies.

8.24.4.1 BibTeX error messages
..............................

If you forget to use ‘\bibliography’ or ‘\bibliographystyle’ in your
document (or, less likely, any ‘\cite’ or ‘\nocite’ command), BibTeX
will issue an error message.  Because BibTeX can be used with any
program, not just LaTeX, the error messages refer to the internal
commands read by BibTeX (from the ‘.aux’ file), rather than the
user-level commands described above.

   Here is a table showing internal commands mentioned in the BibTeX
errors, and the corresponding user-level commands.

‘\bibdata’
     ‘\bibliography’

‘\bibstyle’
     ‘\bibliographystyle’

‘\citation’
     ‘\cite’, ‘\nocite’

   For example, if your document has no ‘\bibliographystyle’ command,
BibTeX complains as follows:

     I found no \bibstyle command---while reading file DOCUMENT.aux

8.27 ‘verbatim’
===============

Synopsis:

     \begin{verbatim}
     LITERAL-TEXT
     \end{verbatim}

   A paragraph-making environment in which LaTeX produces as output
exactly what you type as input.  For instance inside LITERAL-TEXT the
backslash ‘\’ character does not start commands, it produces a printed
‘\’, and carriage returns and blanks are taken literally.  The output
appears in a monospaced typewriter-like font (‘\tt’).

     \begin{verbatim}
     Symbol swearing: %&$#?!.
     \end{verbatim}

   The only restriction on ‘literal-text’ is that it cannot include the
string ‘\end{verbatim}’.

   You cannot use the verbatim environment in the argument to macros,
for instance in the argument to a ‘\section’.  This is not the same as
commands being fragile (*note \protect::), instead it just cannot work,
as the ‘verbatim’ environment changes the catcode regime before
processing its contents, and restore it immediately afterward,
nevertheless with a macro argument the content of the argument has
already be converted to a token list along the catcode regime in effect
when the macro was called.  However, the ‘cprotect’ package can help
with this.

   One common use of verbatim input is to typeset computer code.  Some
packages offer many features not provided by the ‘verbatim’ environment;
two of the most popular are ‘listings’ and ‘minted’.  For example, they
are capable of pretty-printing, line numbering, and selecting parts of
files for a continuing listing.

   A package that provides many more options for verbatim environments
is ‘fancyvrb’.  Another is ‘verbatimbox’.

   For a list of all the relevant packages, see CTAN (*note CTAN::),
particularly the topics ‘listing’ (<https://ctan.org/topic/listing>) and
‘verbatim’ (<https://ctan.org/topic/verbatim>).

8.27.1 ‘\verb’
--------------

Synopsis:

     \verb CHAR LITERAL-TEXT CHAR
     \verb* CHAR LITERAL-TEXT CHAR

   Typeset LITERAL-TEXT as it is input, including special characters and
spaces, using the typewriter (‘\tt’) font.

   This example shows two different invocations of ‘\verb’.

     This is \verb!literally! the biggest pumpkin ever.
     And this is the best squash, \verb+literally!+

The first ‘\verb’ has its LITERAL-TEXT surrounded with exclamation
point, ‘!’.  The second instead uses plus, ‘+’, because the exclamation
point is part of ‘literal-text’.

   The single-character delimiter CHAR surrounds LITERAL-TEXT--it must
be the same character before and after.  No spaces come between ‘\verb’
or ‘\verb*’ and CHAR, or between CHAR and LITERAL-TEXT, or between
LITERAL-TEXT and the second occurrence of CHAR (the synopsis shows a
space only to distinguish one component from the other).  The delimiter
must not appear in LITERAL-TEXT.  The LITERAL-TEXT cannot include a line
break.

   The ‘*’-form differs only in that spaces are printed with a visible
space character.

   The output from this will include a visible space on both side of
word ‘with’:

     The command's first argument is \verb*!filename with extension! and ...

   For typesetting Internet addresses, urls, the package ‘url’ is a
better option than the ‘\verb’ command, since it allows line breaks.

   You cannot use ‘\verb’ in the argument to a macro, for instance in
the argument to a ‘\section’.  It is not a question of ‘\verb’ being
fragile (*note \protect::), instead it just cannot work, as the ‘\verb’
command changes the catcode regime before reading its argument, and
restore it immediately afterward, nevertheless with a macro argument the
content of the argument has already be converted to a token list along
the catcode regime in effect when the macro was called.  However, the
‘cprotect’ package can help with this.

9 Line breaking
***************

The first thing LaTeX does when processing ordinary text is to translate
your input file into a sequence of glyphs and spaces.  To produce a
printed document, this sequence must be broken into lines (and these
lines must be broken into pages).

   LaTeX usually does the line (and page) breaking in the text body for
you but in some environments you manually force line breaks.

   A common workflow is to get a final version of the document content
before taking a final pass through and considering line breaks (and page
breaks).  This differs from word processing, where you are formatting
text as you input it.  Putting these off until the end prevents a lot of
fiddling with breaks that will change anyway.

* Menu:

* \\::                         Start a new line.
* \obeycr & \restorecr::       Make each input line start a new output line.
* \newline::                   Break the line
* \- (hyphenation)::           Insert explicit hyphenation.
* \slash::                     Insert a breakable /.
* \discretionary::             Explicit control of hyphenation character(s).
* \fussy & \sloppy::           Be more or less particular with line breaking.

9.1 ‘\\’
========

Synopsis, one of:

     \\
     \\[MORESPACE]

or one of:

     \\*
     \\*[MORESPACE]

   End the current line.  The optional argument MORESPACE specifies
extra vertical space to be inserted before the next line.  This is a
rubber length (*note Lengths::) and can be negative.  The text before
the line break is set at its normal length, that is, it is not stretched
to fill out the line width.  This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

     \title{My story: \\[0.25in]
            a tale of woe}

The starred form, ‘\\*’, tells LaTeX not to start a new page between the
two lines, by issuing a ‘\nobreak’.

   Explicit line breaks in the main text body are unusual in LaTeX.  In
particular, don't start new paragraphs with ‘\\’.  Instead leave a blank
line between the two paragraphs.  And don't put in a sequence of ‘\\’'s
to make vertical space.  Instead use ‘\vspace{LENGTH}’, or
‘\leavevmode\vspace{LENGTH}’, or ‘\vspace*{LENGTH}’ if you want the
space to not be thrown out at the top of a new page (*note \vspace::).

   The ‘\\’ command is mostly used outside of the main flow of text such
as in a ‘tabular’ or ‘array’ environment or in an equation environment.

   The ‘\\’ command is a synonym for ‘\newline’ (*note \newline::) under
ordinary circumstances (an example of an exception is the ‘p{...}’
column in a ‘tabular’ environment; *note tabular::).

   The ‘\\’ command is a macro, and its definition changes by context so
that its definition in normal text, a ‘center’ environment, a
‘flushleft’ environment, and a ‘tabular’ are all different.  In normal
text when it forces a linebreak it is essentially a shorthand for
‘\newline’.  It does not end horizontal mode or end the paragraph, it
just inserts some glue and penalties so that when the paragraph does end
a linebreak will occur at that point, with the short line padded with
white space.

   You get ‘LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end’ if you use ‘\\’ to
ask for a new line, rather than to end the current line.  An example is
if you have ‘\begin{document}\\’ or, more likely, something like this.

     \begin{center}
       \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
       \\
       In that vertical space put your mark.
       \end{minipage}
     \end{center}

Fix it by replacing the double backslash with something like
‘\vspace{\baselineskip}’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \obeycr & \restorecr,  Next: \newline,  Prev: \\,  Up: Line breaking

9.2 ‘\obeycr’ & ‘\restorecr’
============================

The ‘\obeycr’ command makes a return in the input file (‘^^M’,
internally) the same as ‘\\’, followed by ‘\relax’.  So each new line in
the input will also be a new line in the output.  The ‘\restorecr’
command restores normal line-breaking behavior.

   This is not the way to show verbatim text or computer code.  Use
‘verbatim’ (*note verbatim::) instead.

   With LaTeX's usual defaults, this

     aaa
     bbb

     \obeycr
     ccc
     ddd
        eee

     \restorecr
     fff
     ggg

     hhh
     iii

produces output like this.

       aaa bbb
       ccc
     ddd
     eee

     fff ggg
       hhh iii

The indents are paragraph indents.

9.3 ‘\newline’
==============

In ordinary text, this ends a line in a way that does not right-justify
it, so the text before the end of line is not stretched.  That is, in
paragraph mode (*note Modes::), the ‘\newline’ command is equivalent to
double-backslash (*note \\::).  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).

   However, the two commands are different inside a ‘tabular’ or ‘array’
environment.  In a column with a specifier producing a paragraph box
such as typically ‘p{...}’, ‘\newline’ will insert a line end inside of
the column; that is, it does not break the entire tabular row.  To break
the entire row use ‘\\’ or its equivalent ‘\tabularnewline’.

   This will print ‘Name:’ and ‘Address:’ as two lines in a single cell
of the table.

     \begin{tabular}{p{1in}@{\hspace{2in}}p{1in}}
       Name: \newline Address: &Date: \\ \hline
     \end{tabular}

The ‘Date:’ will be baseline-aligned with ‘Name:’.

9.4 ‘\-’ (discretionary hyphen)
===============================

Tell LaTeX that it may hyphenate the word at that point.  When you
insert ‘\-’ commands in a word, the word will only be hyphenated at
those points and not at any of the other hyphenation points that LaTeX
might otherwise have chosen.  This command is robust (*note \protect::).

   LaTeX is good at hyphenating and usually finds most of the correct
hyphenation points, while almost never using an incorrect one.  The ‘\-’
command is for exceptional cases.

   For example, LaTeX does not ordinarily hyphenate words containing a
hyphen.  Below, the long and hyphenated word means LaTeX has to put in
unacceptably large spaces to set the narrow column.

     \begin{tabular}{rp{1.75in}}
       Isaac Asimov &The strain of
                    anti-intellectualism
                    % an\-ti-in\-tel\-lec\-tu\-al\-ism
                    has been a constant thread winding its way through our
                    political and cultural life, nurtured by
                    the false notion that democracy means that
                    `my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'.
     \end{tabular}

Commenting out the third line and uncommenting the fourth makes a much
better fit.

   The ‘\-’ command only allows LaTeX to break there, it does not
require that it break there.  You can force a split with something like
‘Hef-\linebreak feron’.  Of course, if you later change the text then
this forced break may look out of place, so this approach requires care.

9.5 ‘\slash’: breakable ‘/’
===========================

The ‘\slash’ command produces a ‘/’ character and then a penalty of the
same value as an explicit ‘-’ character (‘\exhyphenpenalty’).  This
allows TeX to break a line at the ‘/’, similar to a hyphen.  Hyphenation
is allowed in the word part preceding the ‘/’, but not after.  For
example:

9.6 ‘\discretionary’ (generalized hyphenation point)
====================================================

Synopsis:

     \discretionary{PRE-BREAK}{POST-BREAK}{NO-BREAK}

   Handle word changes around hyphens.  This command is not often used
in LaTeX documents.

   If a line break occurs at the point where ‘\discretionary’ appears
then TeX puts PRE-BREAK at the end of the current line and puts
POST-BREAK at the start of the next line.  If there is no line break
here then TeX puts NO-BREAK.

   In ‘difficult’ the three letters ‘ffi’ form a ligature.  But TeX can
nonetheless break between the two ‘f’'s with this.

     di\discretionary{f-}{fi}{ffi}cult

   Note that users do not have to do this.  It is typically handled
automatically by TeX's hyphenation algorithm.

9.7 ‘\fussy’ & ‘\sloppy’
========================

Declarations to make TeX more picky or less picky about line breaking.
Declaring ‘\fussy’ usually avoids too much space between words, at the
cost of an occasional overfull box.  Conversely, ‘\sloppy’ avoids
overfull boxes while suffering loose interword spacing.

   The default is ‘\fussy’.  Line breaking in a paragraph is controlled
by whichever declaration is current at the end of the paragraph, i.e.,
at the blank line or ‘\par’ or displayed equation ending that paragraph.
So to affect the line breaks, include that paragraph-ending material in
the scope of the command.

   Typeset the paragraphs with ‘\sloppy’ in effect (*note \fussy &

‘Overfull box’ or ‘Underfull box’ errors.

   The example is simple.

or one of these.

     \nolinebreak
     \nolinebreak[ZERO-TO-FOUR]

   Encourage or discourage a line break.  The optional ZERO-TO-FOUR is
an integer lying between 0 and 4 that allows you to soften the
instruction.  The default is 4, so that without the optional argument
these commands entirely force or prevent the break.  But for instance,
‘\nolinebreak[1]’ is a suggestion that another place may be better.  The
higher the number, the more insistent the request.  Both commands are
fragile (*note \protect::).

   Here we tell LaTeX that a good place to put a linebreak is after the
standard legal text.

     \boilerplatelegal{} \linebreak[2]
     We especially encourage applications from members of traditionally

10 Page breaking
****************

Ordinarily LaTeX automatically takes care of breaking output into pages
with its usual aplomb.  But if you are writing commands, or tweaking the
final version of a document, then you may need to understand how to
influence its actions.

   LaTeX's algorithm for splitting a document into pages is more complex
than just waiting until there is enough material to fill a page and
outputting the result.  Instead, LaTeX typesets more material than would
fit on the page and then chooses a break that is optimal in some way (it
has the smallest “badness”).  An example of the advantage of this
approach is that if the page has some vertical space that can be
stretched or shrunk, such as with rubber lengths between paragraphs,
then LaTeX can use that to avoid widow lines (where a new page starts
with the last line of a paragraph; LaTeX can squeeze the extra line onto
the first page) and orphans (where the first line of paragraph is at the
end of a page; LaTeX can stretch the material of the first page so the
extra line falls on the second page).  Another example is where LaTeX
uses available vertical shrinkage to fit on a page not just the header
for a new section but also the first two lines of that section.

   But LaTeX does not optimize over the entire document's set of page
breaks.  So it can happen that the first page break is great but the
second one is lousy; to break the current page LaTeX doesn't look as far
ahead as the next page break.  So occasionally you may want to influence
page breaks while preparing a final version of a document.

10.1 ‘\clearpage’ & ‘\cleardoublepage’
======================================

Synopsis:

     \clearpage

or

     \cleardoublepage

   End the current page and output all of the pending floating figures
and tables (*note Floats::).  If there are too many floats to fit on the
page then LaTeX will put in extra pages containing only floats.  In
two-sided printing, ‘\cleardoublepage’ also makes the next page of
content a right-hand page, an odd-numbered page, if necessary inserting
a blank page.  The ‘\clearpage’ command is robust while
‘\cleardoublepage’ is fragile (*note \protect::).

   LaTeX's page breaks are optimized so ordinarily you only use this
command in a document body to polish the final version, or inside
commands.

   The ‘\cleardoublepage’ command will put in a blank page, but it will
have the running headers and footers.  To get a really blank page, use
this command.

     \let\origdoublepage\cleardoublepage
     \newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{%
       \clearpage
       {\pagestyle{empty}\origdoublepage}%
     }

If you want LaTeX's standard ‘\chapter’ command to do this then add the
line ‘\let\cleardoublepage\clearemptydoublepage’.  (Of course this
affects all uses of ‘\cleardoublepage’, not just the one in ‘\chapter’.)

   The command ‘\newpage’ (*note \newpage::) also ends the current page,
but without clearing pending floats.  And, if LaTeX is in two-column
mode then ‘\newpage’ ends the current column while ‘\clearpage’ and
‘\cleardoublepage’ end the current page.

   End the current page.  This command is robust (*note \protect::).

   LaTeX's page breaks are optimized so ordinarily you only use this
command in a document body to polish the final version, or inside

   While the commands ‘\clearpage’ and ‘\cleardoublepage’ also end the
current page, in addition they clear pending floats (*note \clearpage &
\cleardoublepage::).  And, if LaTeX is in two-column mode then
‘\clearpage’ and ‘\cleardoublepage’ end the current page, possibly
leaving an empty column, while ‘\newpage’ only ends the current column.

   In contrast with ‘\pagebreak’ (*note \pagebreak & \nopagebreak::),
the ‘\newpage’ command will cause the new page to start right where
requested.  This

10.3 ‘\enlargethispage’
=======================

Synopsis, one of:

     \enlargethispage{SIZE}
     \enlargethispage*{SIZE}

   Enlarge the ‘\textheight’ for the current page.  The required
argument SIZE must be a rigid length (*note Lengths::).  It may be
positive or negative.  This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   A common strategy is to wait until you have the final text of a
document, and then pass through it tweaking line and page breaks.  This
command allows you some page size leeway.

   This will allow one extra line on the current page.

     \enlargethispage{\baselineskip}

   The starred form ‘\enlargesthispage*’ tries to squeeze the material
together on the page as much as possible, for the common use case of
getting one more line on the page.  This is often used together with an
explicit ‘\pagebreak’.

an integer that allows you to soften the request.  The default is 4, so
that without the optional argument these commands entirely force or
prevent the break.  But for instance ‘\nopagebreak[1]’ suggests to LaTeX
that another spot might be preferable.  The higher the number, the more
insistent the request.  Both commands are fragile (*note \protect::).

   LaTeX's page endings are optimized so ordinarily you only use these

‘\pagebreak’ the vertical space on the page is stretched out where
possible so that it extends to the normal bottom margin.  This can look
strange, and if ‘\flushbottom’ is in effect this can cause you to get
‘Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has occurred while \output is active’.
*Note \newpage::, for a command that does not have these effects.

   A declaration ‘\samepage’ and corresponding ‘samepage’ environment
try to only allow breaks between paragraphs.  They are not perfectly
reliable.  For more on keeping material on the same page, see the FAQ
entry <https://texfaq.org/FAQ-nopagebrk>.)

Place a footnote at the bottom of the current page, as here.

     Noël Coward quipped that having to read a footnote is like having
     to go downstairs to answer the door, while in the midst of making
     love.\footnote{%
       I wouldn't know, I don't read footnotes.}

   You can put multiple footnotes on a page.  If the footnote text
becomes too long then it will flow to the next page.

   You can also produce footnotes by combining the ‘\footnotemark’ and
the ‘\footnotetext’ commands, which is useful in special circumstances.

   To make bibliographic references come out as footnotes you need to
include a bibliographic style with that behavior (*note Using BibTeX::).

11.1 ‘\footnote’
================

Synopsis, one of:

     \footnote{TEXT}
     \footnote[NUMBER]{TEXT}

   Place a footnote TEXT at the bottom of the current page, with a
footnote marker at the current position in the text.

     There are over a thousand footnotes in Gibbon's
     \textit{Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire}.\footnote{%
       After reading an early version with endnotes David Hume complained,
       ``One is also plagued with his Notes, according to the present Method
       of printing the Book'' and suggested that they ``only to be printed
       at the Margin or the Bottom of the Page.''}

   The optional argument NUMBER allows you to specify the number of the
footnote.  If you use this then LaTeX does not increment the ‘footnote’
counter.

   By default, LaTeX uses arabic numbers as footnote markers.  Change
this with something like
‘\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}’, which uses a
sequence of symbols (*note \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman
\fnsymbol::).  To make this change global put that in the preamble.  If
you make the change local then you may want to reset the counter with
‘\setcounter{footnote}{0}’.

   LaTeX determines the spacing of footnotes with two parameters.

‘\footnoterule’
     Produces the rule separating the main text on a page from the
     page's footnotes.  Default dimensions in the standard document
     classes (except ‘slides’, where it does not appear) are: vertical
     thickness of ‘0.4pt’, and horizontal size of ‘0.4\columnwidth’
     long.  Change the rule with something like this.

          % \footnoterule is expanded in vertical mode, thus \kern
          % commands ensure that no vertical space is created,
          % and the rule is separated vertically with 2pt
          % above the note text.
          \renewcommand*{\footnoterule}{%
            \kern -3pt                         % This -3 is negative
            \hrule width \textwidth height 1pt % of the sum of this 1
            \kern 2pt}                         % and this 2

‘\footnotesep’
     The height of the strut placed at the beginning of the footnote
     (*note \strut::).  By default, this is set to the normal strut for
     ‘\footnotesize’ fonts (*note Font sizes::), therefore there is no
     extra space between footnotes.  This is ‘6.65pt’ for ‘10pt’,
     ‘7.7pt’ for ‘11pt’, and ‘8.4pt’ for ‘12pt’.  Change it as with
     ‘\setlength{\footnotesep}{11pt}’.

   The ‘\footnote’ command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   LaTeX's default puts many restrictions on where you can use a
‘\footnote’; for instance, you cannot use it in an argument to a
sectioning command such as ‘\chapter’ (it can only be used in outer
paragraph mode; *note Modes::).  There are some workarounds; see
following sections.

   In a ‘minipage’ environment the ‘\footnote’ command uses the
‘mpfootnote’ counter instead of the ‘footnote’ counter, so they are
numbered independently.  They are shown at the bottom of the
environment, not at the bottom of the page.  And by default they are
shown alphabetically.  *Note minipage:: and *note Footnotes in a
table::.

11.2 ‘\footnotemark’
====================

Synopsis, one of:

     \footnotemark
     \footnotemark[NUMBER]

   Put the current footnote mark in the text.  To specify associated
text for the footnote see *note \footnotetext::.  The optional argument
NUMBER causes the command to use that number to determine the footnote
mark.  This command can be used in inner paragraph mode (*note Modes::).

   If you use ‘\footnotemark’ without the optional argument then it
increments the ‘footnote’ counter, but if you use the optional NUMBER
then it does not.  The next example produces several consecutive
footnote markers referring to the same footnote.

     The first theorem\footnote{Due to Gauss.}
     and the second theorem\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]
     and the third theorem.\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]

   If there are intervening footnotes then you must remember the value
of the number of the common mark.  This example gives the same
institutional affiliation to both the first and third authors (‘\thanks’
is a version of ‘\footnote’), by explicitly specifying the number of the
footnote (‘1’).

     \title{A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem}
     \author{J Moriarty\thanks{University of Leeds}
       \and A C Doyle\thanks{Durham University}
       \and S Holmes\footnotemark[1]}
     \begin{document}
     \maketitle

   This example accomplishes the same by using the package ‘cleveref’.

     \usepackage{cleveref}[2012/02/15]   % in preamble
     \crefformat{footnote}{#2\footnotemark[#1]#3}
     ...
     The theorem is from Evers.\footnote{\label{fn:TE}Tinker, Evers, 1994.}
     The corollary is from Chance.\footnote{Evers, Chance, 1990.}
     But the key lemma is from Tinker.\cref{fn:TE}

   It will work with the package ‘hyperref’.

   This uses a counter to remember the footnote number.  The third
sentence is followed by the same footnote marker as the first.

     \newcounter{footnoteValueSaver}
     All babies are illogical.\footnote{%
       Lewis Carroll.}\setcounter{footnoteValueSaver}{\value{footnote}}
     Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.\footnote{%
       Captain Hook.}
     Illogical persons are despised.\footnotemark[\value{footnoteValueSaver}]
     Therefore, anyone who can manage a crocodile is not a baby.

11.3 ‘\footnotetext’
====================

Synopsis, one of:

     \footnotetext{TEXT}
     \footnotetext[NUMBER]{TEXT}

   Place TEXT at the bottom of the page as a footnote.  It pairs with
‘\footnotemark’ (*note \footnotemark::) and can come anywhere after that
command, but must appear in outer paragraph mode (*note Modes::).  The
optional argument NUMBER changes the number of the footnote mark.

   *Note \footnotemark:: and *note Footnotes in a table::, for usage
examples.

11.4 Footnotes in section headings
==================================

Putting a footnote in a section heading, as in:

     \section{Full sets\protect\footnote{This material due to ...}}

causes the footnote to appear at the bottom of the page where the
section starts, as usual, but also at the bottom of the table of
contents, where it is not likely to be desired.  The simplest way to
have it not appear on the table of contents is to use the optional
argument to ‘\section’.

     \section[Please]{Please\footnote{%
       Don't footnote in chapter and section headers!}}

No ‘\protect’ is needed in front of ‘\footnote’ here because what gets
moved to the table of contents is the optional argument.

11.5 Footnotes in a table
=========================

Inside a ‘tabular’ or ‘array’ environment the ‘\footnote’ command does
not work; there is a footnote mark in the table cell but the footnote
text does not appear.  The solution is to use a ‘minipage’ environment
as here (*note minipage::).

     \begin{center}
       \begin{minipage}{\textwidth} \centering
          \begin{tabular}{l|l}
            \textsc{Ship}           &\textsc{Book} \\ \hline
            \textit{HMS Sophie}     &Master and Commander  \\
            \textit{HMS Polychrest} &Post Captain  \\
            \textit{HMS Lively}     &Post Captain \\
            \textit{HMS Surprise}   &A number of books\footnote{%
                                       Starting with \textit{HMS Surprise}.}
          \end{tabular}
       \end{minipage}
     \end{center}

   Inside a ‘minipage’, footnote marks are lowercase letters.  Change
that with something like
‘\renewcommand{\thempfootnote}{\arabic{mpfootnote}}’ (*note \alph \Alph
\arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol::).

   The footnotes in the prior example appear at the bottom of the
‘minipage’.  To have them appear at the bottom of the main page, as part
of the regular footnote sequence, use the ‘\footnotemark’ and
‘\footnotetext’ pair and make a new counter.

     \newcounter{mpFootnoteValueSaver}
     \begin{center}
       \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
         \setcounter{mpFootnoteValueSaver}{\value{footnote}} \centering
          \begin{tabular}{l|l}
            \textsc{Woman}             &\textsc{Relationship} \\ \hline
            Mona                       &Attached\footnotemark  \\
            Diana Villiers             &Eventual wife  \\
            Christine Hatherleigh Wood &Fiance\footnotemark
          \end{tabular}
       \end{minipage}%  percent sign keeps footnote text close to minipage
       \stepcounter{mpFootnoteValueSaver}%
         \footnotetext[\value{mpFootnoteValueSaver}]{%
           Little is known other than her death.}%
       \stepcounter{mpFootnoteValueSaver}%
         \footnotetext[\value{mpFootnoteValueSaver}]{%
           Relationship is unresolved.}
     \end{center}

   For a floating ‘table’ environment (*note table::), use the
‘tablefootnote’ package.

     \usepackage{tablefootnote}  % in preamble
        ...
     \begin{table}
       \centering
          \begin{tabular}{l|l}
          \textsc{Date}  &\textsc{Campaign} \\ \hline
          1862           &Fort Donelson \\
          1863           &Vicksburg     \\
          1865           &Army of Northern Virginia\tablefootnote{%
                           Ending the war.}
          \end{tabular}
         \caption{Forces captured by US Grant}
     \end{table}

The footnote appears at the page bottom and is numbered in sequence with
other footnotes.

Particularly in the humanities, authors can have multiple classes of
footnotes, including having footnotes of footnotes.  The package
‘bigfoot’ extends LaTeX's default footnote mechanism in many ways,
including allow these two, as in this example.

12.1 ‘\newcommand’ & ‘\renewcommand’
====================================

Synopses, one of (three regular forms, three starred forms):

     \newcommand{\CMD}{DEFN}
     \newcommand{\CMD}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \newcommand{\CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}
     \newcommand*{\CMD}{DEFN}
     \newcommand*{\CMD}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \newcommand*{\CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

or the same six possibilities with ‘\renewcommand’ instead of
‘\newcommand’:

     \renewcommand{\CMD}{DEFN}
     \renewcommand{\CMD}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \renewcommand{\CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}
     \renewcommand*{\CMD}{DEFN}
     \renewcommand*{\CMD}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \renewcommand*{\CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

   Define or redefine a command (see also ‘\DeclareRobustCommand’ in
*note Class and package commands::).

   The starred form of these two forbids the arguments from containing
multiple paragraphs of text (i.e., a ‘\par’ token; in plain TeX terms:
the commands are not ‘\long’).  With the default form, arguments can be
multiple paragraphs.

   These are the parameters (examples follow):

CMD
     Required; ‘\CMD’ is the command name.  It must begin with a
     backslash, ‘\’, and must not begin with the four character string
     ‘\end’.  For ‘\newcommand’, it must not be already defined.  For
     ‘\renewcommand’, this name must already be defined.

NARGS
     Optional; an integer from 0 to 9, specifying the number of
     arguments that the command takes, including any optional argument.
     Omitting this argument is the same as specifying 0, meaning that
     the command has no arguments.  If you redefine a command, the new
     version can have a different number of arguments than the old
     version.

OPTARGDEFAULT
     Optional; if this argument is present then the first argument of
     ‘\CMD’ is optional, with default value OPTARGDEFAULT (which may be
     the empty string).  If OPTARGDEFAULT is not present then ‘\CMD’
     does not take an optional argument.

     That is, if ‘\CMD’ is called with a following argument in square
     brackets, as in ‘\CMD[OPTVAL]{...}...’, then within DEFN the
     parameter ‘#1’ is set to OPTVAL.  On the other hand, if ‘\CMD’ is
     called without following square brackets then within DEFN the
     parameter ‘#1’ is set to OPTARGDEFAULT.  In either case, the
     required arguments start with ‘#2’.

     Omitting ‘[OPTARGDEFAULT]’ from the definition is entirely
     different from giving the square brackets with empty contents, as
     in ‘[]’.  The former says the command being defined takes no
     optional argument, so ‘#1’ is the first required argument (if NARGS
     ≥ 1); the latter sets the optional argument ‘#1’ to the empty
     string as the default, if no optional argument was given in the
     call.

     Similarly, omitting ‘[OPTVAL]’ from a call is also entirely
     different from giving the square brackets with empty contents.  The
     former sets ‘#1’ to the value of OPTVAL (assuming the command was
     defined to take an optional argument); the latter sets ‘#1’ to the
     empty string, just as with any other value.

     If a command is not defined to take an optional argument, but is
     called with an optional argument, the results are unpredictable:
     there may be a LaTeX error, there may be incorrect typeset output,
     or both.

DEFN
     Required; the text to be substituted for every occurrence of
     ‘\CMD’.  The parameters ‘#1’, ‘#2’, ..., ‘#NARGS’ are replaced by
     the values supplied when the command is called (or by OPTARGDEFAULT
     in the case of an optional argument not specified in the call, as
     just explained).

   TeX ignores blanks in the source following a control word (*note
Control sequences::), as in ‘\cmd ’.  If you want a space there, one
solution is to type ‘{}’ after the command (‘\cmd{} ’), and another
solution is to use an explicit control space (‘\cmd\ ’).

   A simple example of defining a new command: ‘\newcommand{\RS}{Robin
Smith}’ results in ‘\RS’ being replaced by the longer text.  Redefining
an existing command is similar: ‘\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{{\small
QED}}’.

   If you use ‘\newcommand’ and the command name has already been used
then you get something like ‘LaTeX Error: Command \fred already defined.
Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual’.  Similarly, If you
use ‘\renewcommand’ and the command name has not been defined then you
get something like ‘LaTeX Error: \hank undefined’.

   Here the first definition creates a command with no arguments, and
the second, a command with one required argument:

     \newcommand{\student}{Ms~O'Leary}
     \newcommand{\defref}[1]{Definition~\ref{#1}}

Use the first as in ‘I highly recommend \student{} to you’.  The second
has a variable argument, so that ‘\defref{def:basis}’ expands to
‘Definition~\ref{def:basis}’, which ultimately expands to something like
‘Definition~3.14’.

   Similarly, but with two required arguments:
‘\newcommand{\nbym}[2]{$#1 \times #2$}’ is invoked as ‘\nbym{2}{k}’.

   This example has an optional argument.

     \newcommand{\salutation}[1][Sir or Madam]{Dear #1:}

Then ‘\salutation’ gives ‘Dear Sir or Madam:’ while ‘\salutation[John]’
gives ‘Dear John:’.  And ‘\salutation[]’ gives ‘Dear :’.

   This example has an optional argument and two required arguments.

     \newcommand{\lawyers}[3][company]{#2, #3, and~#1}
     I employ \lawyers[Howe]{Dewey}{Cheatem}.

The output is ‘I employ Dewey, Cheatem, and Howe.’.  The optional
argument, ‘Howe’, is associated with ‘#1’, while ‘Dewey’ and ‘Cheatem’
are associated with ‘#2’ and ‘#3’.  Because of the optional argument,
‘\lawyers{Dewey}{Cheatem}’ will give the output ‘I employ Dewey,
Cheatem, and company.’.

   The braces around DEFN do not define a group, that is, they do not
delimit the scope of the result of expanding DEFN.  For example, with
‘\newcommand{\shipname}[1]{\it #1}’, in this sentence,

     The \shipname{Monitor} met the \shipname{Merrimac}.

the words ‘met the’, and the period, would incorrectly be in italics.
The solution is to put another pair of braces inside the definition:
‘\newcommand{\shipname}[1]{{\it #1}}’.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Control sequences,  Up: \newcommand & \renewcommand

12.1.1 Control sequence, control word and control symbol
--------------------------------------------------------

When reading input TeX converts the stream of read characters into a
sequence of “tokens”.  When TeX sees a backslash ‘\’, it will handle the
following characters in a special way in order to make a “control
sequence” token.

   The control sequences fall into two categories:

   • “control word”, when the control sequence is gathered from a ‘\’
     followed by at least one ASCII letter (‘A-Z’ and ‘a-z’), followed
     by at least one non-letter.

   • “control symbol”, when the control sequence is gathered from a ‘\’
     followed by one non-letter character.

   The sequence of characters so found after the ‘\’ is also called the
“control sequence name”.

   Blanks after a control word are ignored and do not produce any
whitespace in the output (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand:: and *note
\(SPACE)::).

   Just as the ‘\relax’ command does nothing, the following input will
simply print ‘Hello!’ (if you use the Emacs info viewer, turn on the
‘whitespace-mode’ minor mode to see the trailing spaces):

     Hel\relax  
        lo!

This is because blanks after ‘\relax’, including the newline, are
ignored, and blanks at the beginning of a line are also ignored (*note
Leading blanks::).

12.2 ‘\providecommand’

Synopses, one of:

     \providecommand*{\CMD}{DEFN}
     \providecommand*{\CMD}[NARGS]{DEFN}
     \providecommand*{\CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

   Defines a command, as long as no command of this name already exists.
If no command of this name already exists then this has the same effect
as ‘\newcommand’.  If a command of this name already exists then this
definition does nothing.  This is particularly useful in a file that may
be loaded more than once, such as a style file.  *Note \newcommand &
\renewcommand::, for the description of the arguments.

   This example

     \providecommand{\myaffiliation}{Lyc\'ee Henri IV}
     From \myaffiliation.

outputs ‘From Saint Michael's College.’.  Unlike ‘\newcommand’, the
repeated use of ‘\providecommand’ to (try to) define ‘\myaffiliation’
does not give an error.

12.3 ‘\makeatletter’ & ‘\makeatother’
=====================================

Synopsis:

     \makeatletter
       ... definition of commands with @ in their name ..
     \makeatother

   Use this pair when you redefine LaTeX commands that are named with an
at-sign character ‘‘@’’.  The ‘\makeatletter’ declaration makes the
at-sign character have the category code of a letter, code 11.  The
‘\makeatother’ declaration sets the category code of the at-sign to
code 12, its default value.

   As TeX reads characters, it assigns each one a category code, or
“catcode”.  For instance, it assigns the backslash character ‘‘\’’ the
catcode 0.  Command names consist of a category 0 character, ordinarily
backslash, followed by letters, category 11 characters (except that a
command name can also consist of a category 0 character followed by a
single non-letter symbol).

   LaTeX's source code has the convention that some commands use ‘@’ in
their name.  These commands are mainly intended for package or class
writers.  The convention prevents authors who are just using a package
or class from accidentally replacing such a command with one of their
own, because by default the at-sign has catcode 12.

   Use the pair ‘\makeatletter’ and ‘\makeatother’ inside a ‘.tex’ file,
typically in the preamble, when you are defining or redefining commands
named with ‘@’, by having them surround your definition.  Don't use
these inside ‘.sty’ or ‘.cls’ files since the ‘\usepackage’ and
‘\documentclass’ commands already arrange that the at-sign has the
character code of a letter, catcode 11.

   For a comprehensive list of macros with an at-sign in their names see
<https://ctan.org/pkg/macros2e>.

   In this example the class file has a command ‘\thesis@universityname’
that the user wants to change.  These three lines should go in the
preamble, before the ‘\begin{document}’.

     \makeatletter
     \renewcommand{\thesis@universityname}{Saint Michael's College}

     \newcommand{\mycmd@nostar}[NOSTAR-NUM-ARGS]{NOSTAR-BODY}
     \newcommand{\mycmd@star}[STAR-NUM-ARGS]{STAR-BODY}

   Many standard LaTeX environments or commands have a variant with the
same name but ending with a star character ‘*’, an asterisk.  Examples
are the ‘table’ and ‘table*’ environments and the ‘\section’ and
‘\section*’ commands.

   When defining environments, following this pattern is straightforward
because ‘\newenvironment’ and ‘\renewenvironment’ allow the environment
name to contain a star.  So you just have to write
‘\newenvironment{MYENV}’ or ‘\newenvironment{MYENV*}’ and continue the
definition as usual.  For commands the situation is more complex as the
star not being a letter cannot be part of the command name.  As in the
synopsis above, there will be a user-called command, given above as
‘\mycmd’, which peeks ahead to see if it is followed by a star.  For
instance, LaTeX does not really have a ‘\section*’ command; instead, the
‘\section’ command peeks ahead.  This command does not accept arguments
but instead expands to one of two commands that do accept arguments.  In
the synopsis these two are ‘\mycmd@nostar’ and ‘\mycmd@star’.  They
could take the same number of arguments or a different number, or no
arguments at all.  As always, in a LaTeX document a command using an
at-sign ‘@’ in its name must be enclosed inside a ‘\makeatletter ...
\makeatother’ block (*note \makeatletter & \makeatother::).

   This example of ‘\@ifstar’ defines the command ‘\ciel’ and a variant
‘\ciel*’.  Both have one required argument.  A call to ‘\ciel{blue}’
will return "not starry blue sky" while ‘\ciel*{night}’ will return
"starry night sky".

     \makeatletter
     \newcommand*{\ciel@unstarred}[1]{not starry #1 sky}
     \newcommand*{\ciel@starred}[1]{starry #1 sky}
     \newcommand*{\ciel}{\@ifstar{\ciel@starred}{\ciel@unstarred}}
     \makeatother

   In the next example, the starred variant takes a different number of
arguments than the unstarred one.  With this definition, Agent 007's
‘``My name is \agentsecret*{Bond}, \agentsecret{James}{Bond}.''’ is
equivalent to entering the commands ‘``My name is \textsc{Bond},
\textit{James} textsc{Bond}.''’

     \newcommand*{\agentsecret@unstarred}[2]{\textit{#1} \textsc{#2}}
     \newcommand*{\agentsecret@starred}[1]{\textsc{#1}}
     \newcommand*{\agentsecret}{%
       \@ifstar{\agentsecret@starred}{\agentsecret@unstarred}}

   After a command name, a star is handled similarly to an optional
argument.  (This differs from environment names in which the star is
part of the name itself and as such could be in any position.)  Thus, it
is technically possible to put any number of spaces between the command
and the star.  Thus ‘\agentsecret*{Bond}’ and ‘\agentsecret *{Bond}’ are
equivalent.  However, the standard practice is not to insert any such
spaces.

   There are two alternative ways to accomplish the work of ‘\@ifstar’.
(1) The ‘suffix’ package allows the construct
‘\newcommand\mycommand{UNSTARRED-VARIANT}’ followed by
‘\WithSuffix\newcommand\mycommand*{STARRED-VARIANT}’.  (2) LaTeX
provides the ‘xparse’ package, which allows this code:

     \NewDocumentCommand\foo{s}{\IfBooleanTF#1
       {STARRED-VARIANT}%
       {UNSTARRED-VARIANT}%
       }

12.5 ‘\newcounter’: Allocating a counter
========================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \newcounter{COUNTERNAME}
     \newcounter{COUNTERNAME}[SUPERCOUNTER]

   Globally defines a new counter named COUNTERNAME and initialize it to
zero (*note Counters::).

   The name COUNTERNAME must consist of letters only.  It does not begin
with a backslash.  This name must not already be in use by another
counter.

   When you use the optional argument ‘[SUPERCOUNTER]’ then the counter
COUNTERNAME will be reset to zero whenever SUPERCOUNTER is incremented.
For example, ordinarily ‘subsection’ is numbered within ‘section’ so
that any time you increment SECTION, either with ‘\stepcounter’ (*note
\stepcounter::) or ‘\refstepcounter’ (*note \refstepcounter::), then
LaTeX will reset SUBSECTION to zero.

   This example

     \newcounter{asuper}  \setcounter{asuper}{1}
     \newcounter{asub}[asuper] \setcounter{asub}{3}   % Note `asuper'
     The value of asuper is \arabic{asuper} and of asub is \arabic{asub}.
     \stepcounter{asuper}
     Now asuper is \arabic{asuper} while asub is \arabic{asub}.

   produces ‘The value of asuper is 1 and that of asub is 3’ and ‘Now
asuper is 2 while asub is 0’.

   If the counter already exists, for instance by entering ‘asuper’
twice, then you get something like ‘LaTeX Error: Command \c@asuper
already defined. Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.’.

   If you use the optional argument then the super counter must already
exist.  Entering ‘\newcounter{jh}[lh]’ when ‘lh’ is not a defined
counter will get you ‘LaTeX Error: No counter 'lh' defined.’

12.6 ‘\newlength’
=================

Synopsis:

     \newlength{\LEN}

   Allocate a new length register (*note Lengths::).  The required
argument ‘\LEN’ has to be a control sequence (*note Control
sequences::), and as such must begin with a backslash, ‘\’ under normal
circumstances.  The new register holds rubber lengths such as ‘72.27pt’
or ‘1in plus.2in minus.1in’ (a LaTeX length register is what plain TeX
calls a ‘skip’ register).  The initial value is zero.  The control
sequence ‘\LEN’ must not be already defined.

   An example:

     \newlength{\graphichgt}

   If you forget the backslash then you get ‘Missing control sequence
inserted’.  If the control sequence already exists then you get
something like ‘LaTeX Error: Command \graphichgt already defined. Or
name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual’.

12.7 ‘\newsavebox’
==================

Synopsis:

     \newsavebox{\CMD}

   Define \CMD, the string consisting of a backslash followed by CMD, to
refer to a new bin for storing material.  These bins hold material that
has been typeset, to use multiple times or to measure or manipulate
(*note Boxes::).  The bin name \CMD is required, must start with a
backslash, \, and must not already be a defined command.  This command
is fragile (*note \protect::).

   This allocates a bin and then puts typeset material into it.

     \newsavebox{\logobox}
     \savebox{\logobox}{LoGo}
     Our logo is \usebox{\logobox}.

The output is ‘Our logo is LoGo’.

   If there is an already defined bin then you get something like ‘LaTeX
Error: Command \logobox already defined. Or name \end... illegal, see
p.192 of the manual’.

   The allocation of a box is global.

12.8 ‘\newenvironment’ & ‘\renewenvironment’
============================================

Synopses, one of:

     \newenvironment{ENV}{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \newenvironment{ENV}[NARGS]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \newenvironment{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \newenvironment*{ENV}{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \newenvironment*{ENV}[NARGS]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \newenvironment*{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}

or one of these.

     \renewenvironment{ENV}{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \renewenvironment{ENV}[NARGS]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \renewenvironment{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \renewenvironment*{ENV}{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \renewenvironment*{ENV}[NARGS]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}
     \renewenvironment*{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEF}{ENDDEF}

   Define or redefine the environment ENV, that is, create the construct
‘\begin{ENV} ... BODY ... \end{ENV}’.

   The starred form of these commands requires that the arguments not
contain multiple paragraphs of text.  However, the body of these
environments can contain multiple paragraphs.

ENV
     Required; the environment name.  It consists only of letters or the
     ‘*’ character, and thus does not begin with backslash, ‘\’.  It
     must not begin with the string ‘end’.  For ‘\newenvironment’, the
     name ENV must not be the name of an already existing environment,
     and also the command ‘\ENV’ must be undefined.  For
     ‘\renewenvironment’, ENV must be the name of an existing
     environment.

NARGS
     Optional; an integer from 0 to 9 denoting the number of arguments
     of that the environment takes.  When you use the environment these
     arguments appear after the ‘\begin’, as in ‘\begin{ENV}{ARG1} ...
     {ARGN}’.  Omitting this is equivalent to setting it to 0; the
     environment will have no arguments.  When redefining an
     environment, the new version can have a different number of
     arguments than the old version.

OPTARGDEFAULT
     Optional; if this is present then the first argument of the defined
     environment is optional, with default value OPTARGDEFAULT (which
     may be the empty string).  If this is not in the definition then
     the environment does not take an optional argument.

     That is, when OPTARGDEFAULT is present in the definition of the
     environment then you can start the environment with square
     brackets, as in ‘\begin{ENV}[OPTVAL]{...} ... \end{ENV}’.  In this
     case, within BEGDEFN the parameter ‘#1’ is set to the value of
     OPTVAL.  If you call ‘\begin{ENV}’ without square brackets, then
     within BEGDEFN the parameter ‘#1’ is set to the value of the
     default OPTARGDEFAULT.  In either case, any required arguments
     start with ‘#2’.

     Omitting ‘[MYVAL]’ in the call is different than having the square
     brackets with no contents, as in ‘[]’.  The former results in ‘#1’
     expanding to OPTARGDEFAULT; the latter results in ‘#1’ expanding to
     the empty string.

BEGDEF
     Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of ‘\begin{ENV}’.
     Within BEGDEF, the parameters ‘#1’, ‘#2’, ...  ‘#NARGS’, are
     replaced by the values that you supply when you call the
     environment; see the examples below.

ENDDEF
     Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of ‘\end{ENV}’.
     This may not contain any parameters, that is, you cannot use ‘#1’,
     ‘#2’, etc., here (but see the final example below).

   All environments, that is to say the BEGDEF code, the environment
body, and the ENDDEF code, are processed within a group.  Thus, in the
first example below, the effect of the ‘\small’ is limited to the quote
and does not extend to material following the environment.

   If you try to define an environment and the name has already been
used then you get something like ‘LaTeX Error: Command \fred already
defined. Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual’.  If you try
to redefine an environment and the name has not yet been used then you
get something like ‘LaTeX Error: Environment hank undefined.’.

   This example gives an environment like LaTeX's ‘quotation’ except
that it will be set in smaller type.

     \newenvironment{smallquote}{%
       \small\begin{quotation}
     }{%
       \end{quotation}
     }

   This has an argument, which is set in boldface at the start of a
paragraph.

     \newenvironment{point}[1]{%
       \noindent\textbf{#1}
     }{%
     }

   This one shows the use of a optional argument; it gives a quotation
environment that cites the author.

     \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%
       \begin{quotation}
       \noindent\textit{#1}:
     }{%
       \end{quotation}
     }

The author's name is optional, and defaults to ‘Shakespeare’.  In the
document, use the environment like this.

     \begin{citequote}[Lincoln]
       ...
     \end{citequote}

   The final example shows how to save the value of an argument to use
in ENDDEF, in this case in a box (*note \sbox & \savebox::).

     \newsavebox{\quoteauthor}
     \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%
       \sbox\quoteauthor{#1}%
       \begin{quotation}
     }{%
       \hspace{1em plus 1fill}---\usebox{\quoteauthor}
       \end{quotation}
     }

12.9 ‘\newtheorem’
==================

Synopses:

     \newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}
     \newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}[NUMBERED_WITHIN]
     \newtheorem{NAME}[NUMBERED_LIKE]{TITLE}

   Define a new theorem-like environment.  You can specify one of
NUMBERED_WITHIN and NUMBERED_LIKE, or neither, but not both.

   The first form, ‘\newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}’, creates an environment
that will be labelled with TITLE; see the first example below.

   The second form, ‘\newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}[NUMBERED_WITHIN]’, creates
an environment whose counter is subordinate to the existing counter
NUMBERED_WITHIN, so this counter will be reset when NUMBERED_WITHIN is
reset.  See the second example below.

   The third form ‘\newtheorem{NAME}[NUMBERED_LIKE]{TITLE}’, with
optional argument between the two required arguments, creates an
environment whose counter will share the previously defined counter
NUMBERED_LIKE.  See the third example.

   This command creates a counter named NAME.  In addition, unless the
optional argument NUMBERED_LIKE is used, inside of the theorem-like
environment the current ‘\ref’ value will be that of
‘\theNUMBERED_WITHIN’ (*note \ref::).

   This declaration is global.  It is fragile (*note \protect::).

   Arguments:

NAME
     The name of the environment.  It is a string of letters.  It must
     not begin with a backslash, ‘\’.  It must not be the name of an
     existing environment, and the command name ‘\NAME’ must not already
     be defined.

TITLE
     The text to be printed at the beginning of the environment, before
     the number.  For example, ‘Theorem’.

NUMBERED_WITHIN
     Optional; the name of an already defined counter, usually a
     sectional unit such as ‘chapter’ or ‘section’.  When the
     NUMBERED_WITHIN counter is reset then the NAME environment's
     counter will also be reset.

     If this optional argument is not used then the command ‘\theNAME’
     is set to ‘\arabic{NAME}’.

NUMBERED_LIKE
     Optional; the name of an already defined theorem-like environment.
     The new environment will be numbered in sequence with
     NUMBERED_LIKE.

   Without any optional arguments the environments are numbered
sequentially.  The example below has a declaration in the preamble that
results in ‘Definition 1’ and ‘Definition 2’ in the output.

     \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}
     \begin{document}
     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       First def
     \end{defn}

     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       Second def
     \end{defn}

   This example has the same document body as the prior one.  But here
‘\newtheorem’'s optional argument NUMBERED_WITHIN is given as ‘section’,
so the output is like ‘Definition 1.1’ and ‘Definition 2.1’.

     \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}[section]
     \begin{document}
     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       First def
     \end{defn}

     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       Second def
     \end{defn}

   In the next example there are two declarations in the preamble, the
second of which calls for the new ‘thm’ environment to use the same
counter as ‘defn’.  It gives ‘Definition 1.1’, followed by ‘Theorem 2.1’
and ‘Definition 2.2’.

     \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}[section]
     \newtheorem{thm}[defn]{Theorem}
     \begin{document}
     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       First def
     \end{defn}

     \section{...}
     \begin{thm}
       First thm
     \end{thm}

     \begin{defn}
       Second def
     \end{defn}

12.10 ‘\newfont’
================

This command is obsolete.  This description is here only to help with
old documents.  New documents should define fonts in families through
the New Font Selection Scheme which allows you to, for example,
associate a boldface with a roman (*note Fonts::).

   Synopsis:

     \newfont{\CMD}{FONT DESCRIPTION}

   Define a command ‘\CMD’ that will change the current font.  The
control sequence must not already be defined.  It must begin with a
backslash, ‘\’.

   The FONT DESCRIPTION consists of a FONTNAME and an optional “at
clause”.  LaTeX will look on your system for a file named
‘FONTNAME.tfm’.  The at clause can have the form either ‘at DIMEN’ or
‘scaled FACTOR’, where a FACTOR of ‘1000’ means no scaling.  For LaTeX's
purposes, all this does is scale all the character and other font
dimensions relative to the font's design size, which is a value defined
in the ‘.tfm’ file.

   This defines two equivalent fonts and typesets a few characters in
each.

     \newfont{\testfontat}{cmb10 at 11pt}
     \newfont{\testfontscaled}{cmb10 scaled 1100}
     \testfontat abc
     \testfontscaled abc

12.11 ‘\protect’
================

All LaTeX commands are either “fragile” or “robust”.  A fragile command
can break when it is used in the argument to certain other commands,
typically those that write material to the table of contents, the
cross-reference file, etc.  To prevent fragile commands from causing
errors, one solution is to precede them with the command ‘\protect’.

   For example, when LaTeX runs the ‘\section{SECTION NAME}’ command it
writes the SECTION NAME text to the ‘.aux’ auxiliary file, moving it
there for use elsewhere in the document such as in the table of
contents.  Such an argument that is used in multiple places is referred
to as a “moving argument”.  A command is fragile if it can expand during
this process into invalid TeX code.  Some examples of moving arguments
are those that appear in the ‘\caption{...}’ command (*note figure::),
in the ‘\thanks{...}’ command (*note \maketitle::), and in @-expressions
in the ‘tabular’ and ‘array’ environments (*note tabular::).

   If you get strange errors from commands used in moving arguments, try
preceding it with ‘\protect’.  Each fragile command must be protected
with their own ‘\protect’.

   Although usually a ‘\protect’ command doesn't hurt, length commands
such as ‘\parindent’ should not be preceded by a ‘\protect’ command
(*note Lengths::.  Nor can a ‘\protect’ command be used in the argument
to ‘\addtocounter’ or ‘\setcounter’ command (*note \setcounter:: and
*note \addtocounter::.  These commands are already robust.

   As of the October 2019 release of LaTeX
(<https://www.latex-project.org/news/latex2e-news/ltnews30.pdf>), most
commands that had been previously fragile were fixed to be robust.  For
example, any command taking an optional argument, such as ‘\root’ or
‘\raisebox’, was fragile, but is now robust.  Similarly, ‘\(...\)’ math
was fragile and is now robust (‘$...$’ has always been robust).

   Perhaps the most commonly used remaining fragile command is ‘\verb’;
for example,

     \begin{figure}
       ...
       \caption{This \verb|\command| causes an error.}
     \end{figure}

   Adding ‘\protect’ does not help here.  It's usually feasible to
rewrite the caption (or section heading or whatever) to use ‘\texttt’,
often the simplest solution.

   Alternatively, to use ‘\verb’, you can apply the ‘\cprotect’ command
from ‘cprotect’ package (<https://ctan.org/pkg/cprotect>) to the
‘\caption’:

     \cprotect\caption{This \verb|\command| is ok with \verb|\cprotect|.}

   ‘\cprotect’ also allows use of ‘\begin...\end’ environments in moving
arguments, where they are normally not allowed, via a similar prefix
command ‘\cprotEnv’.

12.12 ‘\ignorespaces & \ignorespacesafterend’
=============================================

Synopsis:

     \ignorespaces

or

     \ignorespacesafterend

   Both commands cause LaTeX to ignore blanks (that is, characters of
catcode 10 such as space or tabulation) after the end of the command up
to the first box or non-blank character.  The first is a primitive
command of TeX, and the second is LaTeX-specific.

   The ‘\ignorespaces’ is often used when defining commands via
‘\newcommand’, or ‘\newenvironment’, or ‘\def’.  The example below
illustrates.  It allows a user to show the points values for quiz
questions in the margin but it is inconvenient because, as shown in the
‘enumerate’ list, users must not put any space between the command and
the question text.

     \newcommand{\points}[1]{\makebox[0pt]{\makebox[10em][l]{#1~pts}}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item\points{10}no extra space output here
       \item\points{15} extra space between the number and the `extra'
     \end{enumerate}

The solution is to change to this.

     \newcommand{\points}[1]{%
       \makebox[0pt]{\makebox[10em][l]{#1~pts}}\ignorespaces}

   A second example shows blanks being removed from the front of text.
The commands below allow a user to uniformly attach a title to names.
But, as given, if a title accidentally starts with a space then
‘\fullname’ will reproduce that.

     \newcommand{\honorific}[1]{\def\honorific{#1}} % remember title
     \newcommand{\fullname}[1]{\honorific~#1}       % put title before name

     \begin{tabular}{|l|}
     \honorific{Mr/Ms}  \fullname{Jones} \\  % no extra space here
     \honorific{ Mr/Ms} \fullname{Jones}     % extra space before title
     \end{tabular}

To fix this, change to
‘\newcommand{\fullname}[1]{\ignorespaces\honorific~#1}’.

   The ‘\ignorespaces’ is also often used in a ‘\newenvironment’ at the
end of the BEGIN clause, as in ‘\begin{newenvironment}{ENV NAME}{...
\ignorespaces}{...}’.

   To strip blanks off the end of an environment use
‘\ignorespacesafterend’.  An example is that this will show a much
larger vertical space between the first and second environments than
between the second and third.

     \newenvironment{eq}{\begin{equation}}{\end{equation}}
     \begin{eq}
     e=mc^2
     \end{eq}
     \begin{equation}
     F=ma
     \end{equation}
     \begin{equation}
     E=IR
     \end{equation}

   Putting a comment character ‘%’ immediately after the ‘\end{eq}’ will
make the vertical space disappear, but that is inconvenient.  The
solution is to change to
‘\newenvironment{eq}{\begin{equation}}{\end{equation}\ignorespacesafterend}’.

12.13 ‘xspace’ package
======================

This is an add-on package, not part of core LaTeX.  Synopsis:

     \usepackage{xspace}
       ...
     \newcommand{...}{...\xspace}

   The ‘\xspace’ macro, when used at the end of a command definition,
adds a space unless the command is followed by certain punctuation
characters.

   After a control sequence that is a control word (*note Control
sequences::, as opposed to control symbols such as ‘\$’), TeX gobbles
blank characters.  Thus, in the first sentence below, the output has
‘Vermont’ placed snugly against the period, without any intervening
space, despite the space in the input.

     \newcommand{\VT}{Vermont}
     Our college is in \VT .
     \VT{} summers are nice.

   But because of the gobbling, the second sentence needs the empty
curly braces or else there would be no space separating ‘Vermont’ from
‘summers’.  (Many authors instead use a backslash-space ‘\ ’ for this.
*Note \(SPACE)::.)

   The ‘xspace’ package provides ‘\xspace’.  It is for writing commands
which are designed to be used mainly in text.  It must be placed at the
very end of the definition of these commands.  It inserts a space after
that command unless what immediately follows is in a list of exceptions.
In this example, the empty braces are not needed.

     \newcommand{\VT}{Vermont\xspace}
     Our college is in \VT .
     \VT summers are nice.

   The default exception list contains the characters ‘,.'/?;:!~-)’, the
open curly brace and the backslash-space command discussed above, and
the commands ‘\footnote’ or ‘\footnotemark’.  You can add to that list
as with ‘\xspaceaddexceptions{\myfni \myfnii}’ which adds ‘\myfni’
and ‘\myfnii’ to the list; and you can remove from that list as with
‘\xspaceremoveexception{!}’.

   A comment: many experts prefer not to use ‘\xspace’.  Putting it in a
definition means that the command will usually get the spacing right.
But it isn't easy to predict when to enter empty braces because
‘\xspace’ will get it wrong, such as when it is followed by another
command, and so ‘\xspace’ can make editing material harder and more
error-prone than instead of always inserting the empty braces.

12.14.1 ‘\AtBeginDvi’ & ‘\AtEndDvi’
-----------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \AtBeginDvi{CODE}
     \AtEndDvi{CODE}

   ‘\AtBeginDvi’ saves, in a box register, CODE to be executed at the
beginning of the shipout of the first page of the document.  Despite the
name, it applies to DVI, PDF, and XDV output.  It fills the
‘shipout/firstpage’ hook; new code should use that hook directly.

   Similarly, ‘\AtEndDvi’ (previously available only with the ‘atenddvi’
package) is code executed when finalizing the main output document.

12.14.2 ‘\AtEndOfClass’ & ‘\AtEndOfPackage’
-------------------------------------------

Synopses:

     \AtEndOfClass{CODE}
     \AtEndOfPackage{CODE}

   Hooks to insert CODE to be executed when LaTeX finishes processing
the current class resp. package.

   These hooks can be used multiple times; each ‘code’ segment will be
executed in the order called.  Many packages and classes use these
commands.

   See also *note \AtBeginDocument::.

12.14.3 ‘\CheckCommand’
-----------------------

Synopsis:

     \CheckCommand{CMD}[NUM][DEFAULT]{DEFINITION}
     \CheckCommand* (same parameters)

   Like ‘\newcommand’ (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::) but does not
define CMD; instead it checks that the current definition of CMD is
exactly as given by DEFINITION and is or is not “‘\long’” as expected.
A long command is a command that accepts ‘\par’ within an argument.

   With the unstarred version of ‘\CheckCommand’, CMD is expected to be
‘\long’; with the starred version, CMD must not be ‘\long’

   ‘\CheckCommand’ raises an error when the check fails.  This allows
you to check before you start redefining ‘cmd’ yourself that no other
package has already redefined this command.

12.14.4 ‘\ClassError’ and ‘\PackageError’ and others
----------------------------------------------------

Produce error, warning, and informational messages for classes:

‘\ClassError{CLASS NAME}{ERROR-TEXT}{HELP-TEXT}’
‘\ClassWarning{CLASS NAME}{WARNING-TEXT}’
‘\ClassWarningNoLine{CLASS NAME}{WARNING-TEXT}’
‘\ClassInfo{CLASS NAME}{INFO-TEXT}’
‘\ClassInfoNoLine{CLASS NAME}{INFO-TEXT}’

and the same for packages:
‘\PackageError{PACKAGE NAME}{ERROR-TEXT}{HELP-TEXT}’
‘\PackageWarning{PACKAGE NAME}{WARNING-TEXT}’
‘\PackageWarningNoLine{PACKAGE NAME}{WARNING-TEXT}’
‘\PackageInfo{PACKAGE NAME}{INFO-TEXT}’
‘\PackageInfoNoLine{PACKAGE NAME}{INFO-TEXT}’

   For ‘\ClassError’ and ‘\PackageError’ the message is ERROR-TEXT,
followed by TeX's '‘?’' error prompt.  If the user then asks for help by
typing ‘h’, they see the HELP TEXT.

   The four ‘Warning’ commands are similar except that they write
WARNING-TEXT on the screen with no error prompt.  The four ‘Info’
commands write INFO-TEXT only in the transcript file.  The ‘NoLine’
versions omit the number of the line generating the message, while the
other versions do show that number.

   To format the messages, including the HELP-TEXT: use ‘\protect’ to
stop a command from expanding, get a line break with ‘\MessageBreak’,
and get a space with ‘\space’ when a space character is ignore, most
commonly after a command.

   LaTeX appends a period to the messages.

12.14.5 ‘\CurrentOption’
------------------------

Expands to the name of the option currently being processed.  This can
only be used within the CODE argument of either ‘\DeclareOption’ or
‘\DeclareOption*’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \DeclareOption,  Next: \DeclareRobustCommand,  Prev: \CurrentOption,  Up: Class and package commands

12.14.6 ‘\DeclareOption’
------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareOption{OPTION}{CODE}
     \DeclareOption*{OPTION}{CODE}

   Define an option a user can include in their ‘\documentclass’
command.  For example, a class ‘smcmemo’ could have an option ‘logo’
allowing users to put the institutional logo on the first page.  The
document would start with ‘\documentclass[logo]{smcmemo}’.  To enable
this, the class file must contain ‘\DeclareOption{logo}{CODE}’ (and
later, ‘\ProcessOptions’).

   If you request an option that has not been declared, by default this
will produce a warning like ‘Unused global option(s): [badoption].’ This
can be changed by using ‘\DeclareOption*{CODE}’, which executes CODE for
any unknown option.

   For example, many classes extend an existing class, using code such
as ‘\LoadClass{article}’ (*note \LoadClass::).  In this case, it makes
sense to pass any otherwise-unknown options to the underlying class,
like this:

     \DeclareOption*{%
       \PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}%
     }

   As another example, our class ‘smcmemo’ might allow users to keep
lists of memo recipients in external files, so the user could invoke
‘\documentclass[math]{smcmemo}’ and it will read the file ‘math.memo’.
This code inputs the file if it exists, while if it doesn't, the option
is passed to the ‘article’ class:

     \DeclareOption*{\InputIfFileExists{\CurrentOption.memo}
       {}{%
       \PassOptionsToClass{\CurrentOption}{article}}}

12.14.7 ‘\DeclareRobustCommand’
-------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareRobustCommand{CMD}[NUM][DEFAULT]{DEFINITION}
     \DeclareRobustCommand* (same parameters

   ‘\DeclareRobustCommand’ and its starred form are generally like
‘\newcommand’ and ‘\newcommand*’ (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::),
with the addition that they define a so-called “robust” command, even if
some code within the DEFINITION is fragile.  (For a discussion of robust
and fragile commands, *note \protect::.)

   Also unlike ‘\newcommand’, these do not give an error if macro CMD
already exists; instead, a log message is put into the transcript file
if a command is redefined.  Thus, ‘\DeclareRobustCommand’ can be used to
define new robust commands or to redefine existing commands, making them
robust.

   The starred form, ‘\DeclareRobustCommand*’, disallows the arguments
from containing multiple paragraphs, just like the starred form of
‘\newcommand’ and ‘\renewcommand’.  The meaning of the arguments is the
same.

   Commands defined this way are a bit less efficient than those defined
using ‘\newcommand’ so unless the command's data is fragile and the
command is used within a moving argument, use ‘\newcommand’.

   Related to this, the ‘etoolbox’ package offers three commands and
their starred forms: ‘\newrobustcmd’(‘*’) ‘\renewrobustcmd’(‘*’), and
‘\providerobustcmd’(‘*’).  They are similar to ‘\newcommand’,
‘\renewcommand’, and ‘\providecommand’ and their own starred forms, but
define a robust CMD.  They have two possible advantages compared to
‘\DeclareRobustCommand’:

  1. They use the low-level e-TeX protection mechanism rather than the
     higher-level LaTeX ‘\protect’ mechanism, so they do not incur the
     slight loss of performance mentioned above, and

  2. They make the same distinction between ‘\new...’, ‘\renew...’, and
     ‘\provide...’, as the standard commands.  That is, they do not just
     write a log message when you redefine CMD that already exists; you
     need to use either ‘\renew...’ or ‘\provide...’, or you get an
     error.  This may or may not be a benefit.

12.14.8 ‘\ExecuteOptions’
-------------------------

Synopsis:

     \ExecuteOptions{OPTION-LIST}

   For each option OPTION in OPTION-LIST, in order, this command
executes the command ‘\ds@OPTION’.  If this command is not defined then
that option is silently ignored.

   This can be used to provide a default option list before
‘\ProcessOptions’.  For example, if in a class file you want the default
to be 11pt fonts then you could specify
‘\ExecuteOptions{11pt}\ProcessOptions\relax’.

12.14.9 ‘\IfFileExists’ & ‘\InputIfFileExists’
----------------------------------------------

Synopses:

     \IfFileExists{FILENAME}{TRUE-CODE}{FALSE-CODE}
     \InputIfFileExists{FILENAME}{TRUE-CODE}{FALSE-CODE}

   ‘\IfFileExists’ executes TRUE-CODE if LaTeX finds the file ‘FILENAME’
or FALSE-CODE otherwise.  In the first case it executing TRUE-CODE and
then inputs the file.  Thus the command

     \IfFileExists{img.pdf}{%
       \includegraphics{img.pdf}}
       {\typeout{!! img.pdf not found}

will include the graphic ‘img.pdf’ if it is found and otherwise give a
warning.

   This command looks for the file in all search paths that LaTeX uses,
not only in the current directory.  To look only in the current
directory do something like
‘\IfFileExists{./FILENAME}{TRUE-CODE}{FALSE-CODE}’.  If you ask for a
filename without a ‘.tex’ extension then LaTeX will first look for the
file by appending the ‘.tex’; for more on how LaTeX handles file
extensions see *note \input::.

   ‘\InputIfFileExists’ is similar, but, as the name states,
automatically ‘\input’s FILENAME if it exists.  The TRUE-CODE is
executed just before the ‘\input’; if the file doesn't exist, the
FALSE-CODE is executed.  An example:

     \InputIfFileExists{mypkg.cfg}
       {\PackageInfo{Loading mypkg.cfg for configuration information}}
       {\PackageInfo{No mypkg.cfg found}}

12.14.10 ‘\LoadClass’ & ‘\LoadClassWithOptions’
-----------------------------------------------

Synopses:

     \LoadClass[OPTIONS-LIST]{CLASS-NAME}[RELEASE-DATE]
     \LoadClassWithOptions{CLASS-NAME}[RELEASE-DATE]

   Load a class, as with
‘\documentclass[OPTIONS-LIST]{CLASS-NAME}[RELEASE-DATE]’.  An example:
‘\LoadClass[twoside]{article}’.

   The OPTIONS-LIST, if present, is a comma-separated list.  The
RELEASE-DATE is also optional.  If present it must have the form
‘YYYY/MM/DD’.

   If you request RELEASE-DATE and the date of the package installed on
your system is earlier, then you get a warning on the screen and in the
log like this:

     You have requested, on input line 4, version `2038/01/19' of
     document class article, but only version `2014/09/29 v1.4h
     Standard LaTeX document class' is available.

   The command version ‘\LoadClassWithOptions’ uses the list of options
for the current class.  This means it ignores any options passed to it
via ‘\PassOptionsToClass’.  This is a convenience command that lets you
build classes on existing ones, such as the standard ‘article’ class,
without having to track which options were passed.

12.14.11 ‘\NeedsTeXFormat’
--------------------------

Synopsis:

     \NeedsTeXFormat{FORMAT}[FORMAT-DATE]

   Specifies the format that this class must be run under.  Often issued
as the first line of a class file, and most often used as:
‘\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}’.  When a document using that class is
processed, the format being run must exactly match the FORMAT name
given, including case.  If it does not match then execution stops with
an error like ‘This file needs format `LaTeX2e' but this is `plain'.’.

   To require a version of the format that you know to have certain
features, include the optional FORMAT-DATE on which those features were
implemented.  If present, it must be in the form ‘YYYY/MM/DD’.  If the
format version installed on your system is earlier than FORMAT DATE then
you get a warning like this.

     You have requested release `2038/01/20' of LaTeX, but only
     release `2016/02/01' is available.

--------------------------------------------------------

Synopses:

     \PassOptionsToClass{OPTIONS}{CLSNAME}
     \PassOptionsToPackage{OPTION}{PKGNAME}

   Adds the options in the comma-separated list OPTIONS to the options
used by any future ‘\RequirePackage’ or ‘\usepackage’ command for the
class CLSNAME or the package PKGNAME, respectively.

   The reason for these commands is that although you may load a package
any number of times with no options, if you can specify options only the
first time you load the package.  Loading a package with options more
than once will get you an error like ‘Option clash for package foo.’.
LaTeX throws an error even if there is no conflict between the options.

   If your own code is bringing in a package twice then you can combine
the calls; for example, replacing the two

     \RequirePackage[landscape]{geometry}
     \RequirePackage[margins=1in]{geometry}

with the single command

     \RequirePackage[landscape,margins=1in]{geometry}

   However, suppose you are loading ‘firstpkg’ and inside that package
it loads ‘secondpkg’, and you need ‘secondpkg’ to be loaded with option
‘draft’.  Then before load the first package you must tell LaTeX about
the desired options for the second package, like this:

     \PassOptionsToPackage{draft}{secondpkg}
     \RequirePackage{firstpkg}

If ‘firstpkg.sty’ loads an option in conflict with what you want then
you may have to alter its source, or yours.

   These commands are useful for general users as well as class and
package writers.  For instance, suppose a user wants to load the
‘graphicx’ package with the option ‘draft’ and also wants to use a class
‘foo’ that loads the ‘graphicx’ package, but without that option.  The
user could start their LaTeX file with
‘\PassOptionsToPackage{draft}{graphicx} \documentclass{foo}’.

12.14.14 ‘\ProcessOptions’
--------------------------

Synopsis:

     \ProcessOptions\@OPTIONS
     \ProcessOptions*\@OPTIONS

   Execute the code for each option that the user has invoked.  Invoke
it in the class file as ‘\ProcessOptions\relax’ (because of the
existence of the starred version, described below).

   Options come in two types.  “Local options” have been specified for
this particular package in ‘\usepackage[OPTIONS]’,
‘\RequirePackage[OPTIONS]’, or the OPTIONS argument of
‘\PassOptionsToPackage{OPTIONS}’.  “Global options” are those given by
the class user in ‘\documentclass[OPTIONS]’.  If an option is specified
both locally and globally then it is local.

   When ‘\ProcessOptions’ is called for a package ‘pkg.sty’, the
following happens:

  1. For each option OPTION so far declared with ‘\DeclareOption’,
     ‘\ProcessOptions’ looks to see if that option is either global or
     local for ‘pkg’.  If so, then it executes the declared code.  This
     is done in the order in which these options were given in
     ‘pkg.sty’.

  2. For each remaining local option, it executes the command
     ‘\ds@’OPTION if it has been defined somewhere (other than by a
     ‘\DeclareOption’); otherwise, it executes the default option code
     given in ‘\DeclareOption*’.  If no default option code has been
     declared then it gives an error message.  This is done in the order
     in which these options were specified.

   When ‘\ProcessOptions’ is called for a class it works in the same way
except that all options are local, and the default CODE for
‘\DeclareOption*’ is ‘\OptionNotUsed’ rather than an error.

   The starred version ‘\ProcessOptions*’ executes the options in the
order specified in the calling commands, rather than in the order of
declaration in the class or package.  For a package, this means that the
global options are processed first.

12.14.15 ‘\ProvidesClass’ & ‘\ProvidesPackage’
----------------------------------------------

Synopses:

     \ProvidesClass{CLSNAME}[RELEASE-DATE [INFO-TEXT]]
     \ProvidesPackage{PKGNAME}[RELEASE-DATE [INFO-TEXT]]

   Identifies the class or package being defined, printing a message to
the screen and the log file.

   When you load a class or package, for example with
‘\documentclass{smcmemo}’ or ‘\usepackage{test}’, LaTeX inputs a file
(‘smcmemo.cls’ and ‘test.sty’, respectively).  If the name of the file
does not match the class or package name declared in it then you get a
warning.  Thus, if you invoke ‘\documentclass{smcmemo}’, and the file
‘smcmemo.cls’ has the statement ‘\ProvidesClass{foo}’ then you get a
warning like ‘You have requested document class `smcmemo', but the
document class provides 'foo'.’ This warning does not prevent LaTeX from
processing the rest of the class file normally.

   If you include the optional argument then you must include a date,
before any spaces, of the form ‘YYYY/MM/DD’.  The rest of the optional
argument is free-form, although it traditionally identifies the class.
It is written to the screen during compilation and to the log file.
Thus, if your file ‘smcmemo.cls’ contains the line
‘\ProvidesClass{smcmemo}[2008/06/01 v1.0 SMC memo class]’ and your
document's first line is ‘\documentclass{smcmemo}’ then you will see
‘Document Class: smcmemo 2008/06/01 v1.0 SMC memo class’.

   The date in the optional argument allows class and package users to
ask to be warned if the version of the class or package is earlier than
RELEASE DATE.  For instance, a user could enter
‘\documentclass{smcmemo}[2018/10/12]’ or
‘\usepackage{foo}[[2017/07/07]]’ to require a class or package with
certain features by specifying that it must be released no earlier than
the given date.  Perhaps more importantly, the date serves as
documentation of the last release.  (In practice, package users rarely
include a date, and class users almost never do.)

   Declare a file other than the main class and package files, such as a

to the log file, essentially like ‘\ProvidesClass’ and
‘\ProvidesPackage’ (see the previous section).

   For example:

     \ProvidesFile{smcmemo.cfg}[2017/10/12 config file for smcmemo.cls]

writes this into the log:

     File: smcmemo.cfg 2017/10/12 config file for smcmemo.cls

---------------------------------------------------------

Synopsis:

     \RequirePackage[OPTION-LIST]{PKGNAME}[RELEASE-DATE]
     \RequirePackageWithOptions{PKGNAME}[RELEASE-DATE]

   Load a package, like the command ‘\usepackage’ (*note Additional
packages::).  An example:
‘\RequirePackage[landscape,margin=1in]{geometry}’

   The initial optional argument OPTION-LIST, if present, must be a
comma-separated list.  The trailing optional argument RELEASE-DATE, if
present, must have the form ‘YYYY/MM/DD’.  If the release date of the
package as installed on your system is earlier than RELEASE-DATE then
you get a warning like ‘You have requested, on input line 9, version
`2017/07/03' of package jhtest, but only version `2000/01/01' is
available’.

   The ‘\RequirePackageWithOptions’ variant uses the list of options for
the current class.  This means it ignores any options passed to it via
‘\PassOptionsToClass’.  This is a convenience command to allow easily
building classes on existing ones without having to track which options
were passed.

   The difference between ‘\usepackage’ and ‘\RequirePackage’ is small.
The ‘\usepackage’ command is intended to be used in documents, while
‘\RequirePackage’ is intended for package and class files.  The most
significant difference in practice is that ‘\RequirePackage’ can be used
in a document before the ‘\documentclass’ command, while ‘\usepackage’
gives an error there.  The most common need for this nowadays is for the
‘\DocumentMetadata’ command (*note \DocumentMetadata::).

   The LaTeX development team strongly recommends use of these and
related commands over Plain TeX's ‘\input’; see the Class Guide
(<https://ctan.org/pkg/clsguide>).

13 Counters
***********

Everything LaTeX numbers for you has a counter associated with it.  The
name of the counter is often the same as the name of the environment or
command associated with the number, except that the counter's name has
no backslash ‘\’.  Thus, associated with the ‘\chapter’ command is the
‘chapter’ counter that keeps track of the chapter number.

   Below is a list of the counters used in LaTeX's standard document
classes to control numbering.

     part            paragraph       figure          enumi
     chapter         subparagraph    table           enumii
     section         page            footnote        enumiii
     subsection      equation        mpfootnote      enumiv
     subsubsection

   The ‘mpfootnote’ counter is used by the ‘\footnote’ command inside of
a minipage (*note minipage::).  The counters ‘enumi’ through ‘enumiv’
are used in the ‘enumerate’ environment, for up to four levels of
nesting (*note enumerate::).

   Counters can have any integer value but they are typically positive.

   New counters are created with ‘\newcounter’.  *Note \newcounter::.

* Menu:

* \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol:: Print value of a counter.
* \usecounter::           Use a specified counter in a list environment.
* \value::                Use the value of a counter in an expression.
* \setcounter::           Set the value of a counter.
* \addtocounter::         Add a quantity to a counter.
* \refstepcounter::       Add to a counter.
* \stepcounter::          Add to a counter, resetting subsidiary counters.
* \day & \month & \year:: Numeric date values.

13.1 ‘\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol’: Printing counters
=====================================================================

Print the value of a counter, in a specified style.  For instance, if
the counter COUNTER has the value 1 then a ‘\alph{COUNTER}’ in your
source will result in a lowercase letter a appearing in the output.

   All of these commands take a single counter as an argument, for
instance, ‘\alph{enumi}’.  Note that the counter name does not start
with a backslash.

‘\alph{COUNTER}’
     Print the value of COUNTER in lowercase letters: 'a', 'b', ...  If
     the counter's value is less than 1 or more than 26 then you get
     ‘LaTeX Error: Counter too large.’

‘\Alph{COUNTER}’
     Print in uppercase letters: 'A', 'B', ...  If the counter's value
     is less than 1 or more than 26 then you get ‘LaTeX Error: Counter
     too large.’

‘\arabic{COUNTER}’
     Print in Arabic numbers such as ‘5’ or ‘-2’.

‘\roman{COUNTER}’
     Print in lowercase roman numerals: 'i', 'ii', ...  If the counter's
     value is less than 1 then you get no warning or error but LaTeX
     does not print anything in the output.

‘\Roman{COUNTER}’
     Print in uppercase roman numerals: 'I', 'II', ...  If the counter's
     value is less than 1 then you get no warning or error but LaTeX
     does not print anything in the output.

‘\fnsymbol{COUNTER}’
     Prints the value of COUNTER using a sequence of nine symbols that
     are traditionally used for labeling footnotes.  The value of
     COUNTER should be between 1 and 9, inclusive.  If the counter's
     value is less than 0 or more than 9 then you get ‘LaTeX Error:
     Counter too large’, while if it is 0 then you get no error or
     warning but LaTeX does not output anything.

     Here are the symbols:

13.2 ‘\usecounter’
==================

Synopsis:

     \usecounter{COUNTER}

   Used in the second argument of the ‘list’ environment (*note list::),
this declares that list items will be numbered by COUNTER.  It
initializes COUNTER to zero, and arranges that when ‘\item’ is called
without its optional argument then COUNTER is incremented by
‘\refstepcounter’, making its value be the current ‘ref’ value (*note
\ref::).  This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   Put in the document preamble, this example makes a new list
environment enumerated with TESTCOUNTER:

     \newcounter{testcounter}
     \newenvironment{test}{%
       \begin{list}{}{%
         \usecounter{testcounter}
       }
     }{%
       \end{list}
     }

13.3 ‘\value’
=============

Synopsis:

     \value{COUNTER}

   Expands to the value of the counter COUNTER.  (Note that the name of
a counter does not begin with a backslash.)

   This example outputs ‘Test counter is 6. Other counter is 5.’.

     \newcounter{test} \setcounter{test}{5}
     \newcounter{other} \setcounter{other}{\value{test}}
     \addtocounter{test}{1}

     Test counter is \arabic{test}.
     Other counter is \arabic{other}.

   The ‘\value’ command is not used for typesetting the value of the
counter.  For that, see *note \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman
\fnsymbol::.

   It is often used in ‘\setcounter’ or ‘\addtocounter’ but ‘\value’ can
be used anywhere that LaTeX expects a number, such as in
‘\hspace{\value{foo}\parindent}’.  It must not be preceded by ‘\protect’
(*note \protect::).

   This example inserts ‘\hspace{4\parindent}’.

     \setcounter{myctr}{3} \addtocounter{myctr}{1}
     \hspace{\value{myctr}\parindent}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \setcounter,  Next: \addtocounter,  Prev: \value,  Up: Counters

13.4 ‘\setcounter’
==================

Synopsis:

     \setcounter{COUNTER}{VALUE}

   Globally set the counter COUNTER to have the value of the VALUE
argument, which must be an integer.  Thus, you can set a counter's value
as ‘\setcounter{section}{5}’.  Note that the counter name does not start
with a backslash.

   In this example if the counter ‘theorem’ has value 12 then the second
line will print ‘XII’.

     \setcounter{exercise}{\value{theorem}}
     Here it is in Roman: \Roman{exercise}.

13.5 ‘\addtocounter’
====================

Synopsis:

     \addtocounter{COUNTER}{VALUE}

   Globally increment COUNTER by the amount specified by the VALUE
argument, which may be negative.

   In this example the section value appears as ‘VII’.

     \setcounter{section}{5}
     \addtocounter{section}{2}
     Here it is in Roman: \Roman{section}.

13.6 ‘\refstepcounter’
======================

Synopsis:

     \refstepcounter{COUNTER}

   Globally increments the value of COUNTER by one, as does
‘\stepcounter’ (*note \stepcounter::).  The difference is that this
command resets the value of any counter numbered within it.  (For the
definition of "counters numbered within", *note \newcounter::.)

   In addition, this command also defines the current ‘\ref’ value to be
the result of ‘\thecounter’.

   While the counter value is set globally, the ‘\ref’ value is set
locally, i.e., inside the current group.

13.7 ‘\stepcounter’
===================

Synopsis:

     \stepcounter{COUNTER}

   Globally adds one to COUNTER and resets all counters numbered within
it.  (For the definition of "counters numbered within", *note
\newcounter::.)

   This command differs from ‘\refstepcounter’ in that this one does not
influence references; that is, it does not define the current ‘\ref’
value to be the result of ‘\thecounter’ (*note \refstepcounter::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \day & \month & \year,  Prev: \stepcounter,  Up: Counters

13.8 ‘\day’ & ‘\month’ & ‘\year’
================================

LaTeX defines the counter ‘\day’ for the day of the month (nominally
with value between 1 and 31), ‘\month’ for the month of the year
(nominally with value between 1 and 12), and ‘\year’ for the year.  When
TeX starts up, they are set from the current values on the system.  The
related command ‘\today’ produces a string representing the current day
(*note \today::).

   They counters are not updated as the job progresses so in principle
they could be incorrect by the end.  In addition, TeX does no sanity
check:

     \day=-2 \month=13 \year=-4 \today

gives no error or warning and results in the output ‘-2, -4’ (the bogus
month value produces no output).

   *Note Command line input::, to force the date to a given value from
the command line.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Lengths,  Next: Making paragraphs,  Prev: Counters,  Up: Top

14 Lengths
**********

A “length” is a measure of distance.  Many LaTeX commands take a length
as an argument.

   Lengths come in two types.  A “rigid length” such as ‘10pt’ does not
contain a ‘plus’ or ‘minus’ component.  (Plain TeX calls this a
“dimen”.)  A “rubber length” (what plain TeX calls a “skip” or “glue”)
such as with ‘1cm plus0.05cm minus0.01cm’ can contain either or both of
those components.  In that rubber length, the ‘1cm’ is the “natural
length” while the other two, the ‘plus’ and ‘minus’ components, allow
TeX to stretch or shrink the length to optimize placement.

   The illustrations below use these two commands.

     % make a black bar 10pt tall and #1 wide
     \newcommand{\blackbar}[1]{\rule{#1}{10pt}}

     % Make a box around #2 that is #1 wide (excluding the border)
     \newcommand{\showhbox}[2]{%
       \fboxsep=0pt\fbox{\hbox to #1{#2}}}

This next example uses those commands to show a black bar 100 points
long between ‘ABC’ and ‘XYZ’.  This length is rigid.

     ABC\showhbox{100pt}{\blackbar{100pt}}XYZ

   As for rubber lengths, shrinking is simpler one: with ‘1cm minus
0.05cm’, the natural length is 1cm but TeX can shrink it down as far as
0.95cm.  Beyond that, TeX refuses to shrink any more.  Thus, below the
first one works fine, producing a space of 98 points between the two
bars.

     ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
       \blackbar{101pt}\hspace{100pt minus 2pt}\blackbar{101pt}}YYY

     ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
       \blackbar{105pt}\hspace{100pt minus 1pt}\blackbar{105pt}}YYY

But the second one gets a warning like ‘Overfull \hbox (1.0pt too wide)
detected at line 17’.  In the output the first ‘Y’ is overwritten by the
end of the black bar, because the box's material is wider than the 300pt
allocated, as TeX has refused to shrink the total to less than
309 points.

   Stretching is like shrinking except that if TeX is asked to stretch
beyond the given amount, it will do it.  Here the first line is fine,
producing a space of 110 points between the bars.

     ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
       \blackbar{95pt}\hspace{100pt plus 10pt}\blackbar{95pt}}YYY

     ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
       \blackbar{95pt}\hspace{100pt plus 1pt}\blackbar{95pt}}YYY

In the second line TeX needs a stretch of 10 points and only 1 point was
specified.  TeX stretches the space to the required length but it gives
you a warning like ‘Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) detected at line
22’.  (We won't discuss badness.)

   You can put both stretch and shrink in the same length, as in ‘1ex
plus 0.05ex minus 0.02ex’.

   If TeX is setting two or more rubber lengths then it allocates the
stretch or shrink in proportion.

     ABC\showhbox{300pt}{%
       \blackbar{100pt}%  left
       \hspace{0pt plus 50pt}\blackbar{80pt}\hspace{0pt plus 10pt}%  middle
       \blackbar{100pt}}YYY  % right

The left and right bars take up 100 points, so the middle needs another
100.  The middle bar is 80 points so the two ‘\hspace’'s must stretch
20 points.  Because the two are ‘plus 50pt’ and ‘plus 10pt’, TeX gets
5/6 of the stretch from the first space and 1/6 from the second.

   The ‘plus’ or ‘minus’ component of a rubber length can contain a
“fill” component, as in ‘1in plus2fill’.  This gives the length infinite
stretchability or shrinkability so that TeX could set it to any
distance.  Here the two figures will be equally spaced across the page.

     \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
       \hspace{0pt plus 1fill}\includegraphics{godel.png}%
       \hspace{0pt plus 1fill}\includegraphics{einstein.png}%
       \hspace{0pt plus 1fill}
     \end{minipage}

   TeX has three levels of infinity for glue components: ‘fil’, ‘fill’,
and ‘filll’.  The later ones are more infinite than the earlier ones.
Ordinarily document authors only use the middle one (*note \hfill:: and
*note \vfill::).

   Multiplying a rubber length by a number turns it into a rigid length,
so that after ‘\setlength{\ylength}{1in plus 0.2in}’ and
‘\setlength{\zlength}{3\ylength}’ then the value of ‘\zlength’ is ‘3in’.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Units of length,  Next: \setlength,  Up: Lengths

14.1 Units of length
====================

TeX and LaTeX know about these units both inside and outside of math
mode.

‘pt’
     Point, 1/72.27 inch.  The (approximate) conversion to metric units
     is 1point = .35146mm = .035146cm.

‘pc’
     Pica, 12 pt

‘in’
     Inch, 72.27 pt

‘bp’
     Big point, 1/72 inch.  This length is the definition of a point in
     PostScript and many desktop publishing systems.

‘mm’
     Millimeter, 2.845pt

‘cm’
     Centimeter, 10mm

‘dd’
     Didot point, 1.07 pt

‘cc’
     Cicero, 12 dd

‘sp’
     Scaled point, 1/65536 pt

   Three other units are defined according to the current font, rather
than being an absolute dimension.

‘ex’
     The x-height of the current font “ex”, traditionally the height of
     the lowercase letter x, is often used for vertical lengths.

‘em’
     Similarly “em”, traditionally the width of the capital letter M, is
     often used for horizontal lengths.  This is also often the size of
     the current font, e.g., a nominal 10pt font will have 1em = 10pt.
     LaTeX has several commands to produce horizontal spaces based on
     the em (*note \enspace & \quad & \qquad::).

‘mu’
     Finally, in math mode, many definitions are expressed in terms of
     the math unit “mu”, defined by 1em = 18mu, where the em is taken
     from the current math symbols family.  *Note Spacing in math
     mode::.

   Using these units can help make a definition work better across font
changes.  For example, a definition of the vertical space between list
items given as ‘\setlength{\itemsep}{1ex plus 0.05ex minus 0.01ex}’ is
more likely to still be reasonable if the font is changed than a
definition given in points.

14.2 ‘\setlength’
=================

Synopsis:

     \setlength{\LEN}{AMOUNT}

   Set the length \LEN to AMOUNT.  The length name ‘\LEN’ has to be a
control sequence (*note Control sequences::), and as such must begin
with a backslash, ‘\’ under normal circumstances.  The AMOUNT can be a
rubber length (*note Lengths::).  It can be positive, negative or zero,
and can be in any units that LaTeX understands (*note Units of
length::).

   Below, with LaTeX's defaults the first paragraph will be indented
while the second will not.

     I told the doctor I broke my leg in two places.

     \setlength{\parindent}{0em}
     He said stop going to those places.

   If you did not declare \LEN with ‘\newlength’, for example if you
mistype it as in
‘\newlength{\specparindent}\setlength{\sepcparindent}{...}’, then you
get an error like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument> \sepcindent’.
If you omit the backslash at the start of the length name then you get
an error like ‘Missing number, treated as zero.’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addtolength,  Next: \settodepth,  Prev: \setlength,  Up: Lengths

14.3 ‘\addtolength’
===================

Synopsis:

     \addtolength{\LEN}{AMOUNT}

   Increment the length \LEN by AMOUNT.  The length name ‘\LEN’ has to
be a control sequence (*note Control sequences::), and as such must
begin with a backslash, ‘\’ under normal circumstances.  The AMOUNT is a
rubber length (*note Lengths::).  It can be positive, negative or zero,
and can be in any units that LaTeX understands (*note Units of
length::).

   Below, if ‘\parskip’ starts with the value ‘0pt plus 1pt’

     Doctor: how is the boy who swallowed the silver dollar?
     \addtolength{\parskip}{1pt}

     Nurse: no change.

then it has the value ‘1pt plus 1pt’ for the second paragraph.

   If you did not declare \LEN with ‘\newlength’, for example if you
mistype it as in
‘\newlength{\specparindent}\addtolength{\sepcparindent}{...}’, then you
get an error like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument> \sepcindent’.
If the AMOUNT uses some length that has not been declared, for instance
if for example you mistype the above as
‘\addtolength{\specparindent}{0.6\praindent}’, then you get something
like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument> \praindent’.  If you leave
off the backslash at the start of \LEN, as in
‘\addtolength{parindent}{1pt}’, then you get something like ‘You can't
use `the letter p' after \advance’.

14.4 ‘\settodepth’
==================

Synopsis:

     \settodepth{\LEN}{TEXT}

   Set the length \LEN to the depth of box that LaTeX gets on
typesetting the TEXT argument.  The length name ‘\LEN’ has to be a
control sequence (*note Control sequences::), and as such must begin
with a backslash, ‘\’ under normal circumstances.

   This will print how low the character descenders go.

     \newlength{\alphabetdepth}
     \settodepth{\alphabetdepth}{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}
     \the\alphabetdepth

   If you did not declare \LEN with ‘\newlength’, if for example you
mistype the above as ‘\settodepth{\aplhabetdepth}{abc...}’, then you get
something like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument> \aplhabetdepth’.
If you leave the backslash out of \LEN, as in
‘\settodepth{alphabetdepth}{...}’ then you get something like ‘Missing
number, treated as zero. <to be read again> \setbox’.

14.5 ‘\settoheight’
===================

Synopsis:

     \settoheight{\LEN}{text}

   Sets the length \LEN to the height of box that LaTeX gets on
typesetting the ‘text’ argument.  The length name ‘\LEN’ has to be a
control sequence (*note Control sequences::), and as such must begin
with a backslash, ‘\’ under normal circumstances.

   This will print how high the characters go.

     \newlength{\alphabetheight}
     \settoheight{\alphabetheight}{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}
     \the\alphabetheight

   If no such length \LEN has been declared with ‘\newlength’, if for
example you mistype as ‘\settoheight{\aplhabetheight}{abc...}’, then you
get something like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument>
\alphabetheight’.  If you leave the backslash out of \LEN, as in
‘\settoheight{alphabetheight}{...}’ then you get something like ‘Missing
number, treated as zero. <to be read again> \setbox’.

14.6 ‘\settowidth’
==================

Synopsis:

     \settowidth{\LEN}{TEXT}

   Set the length \LEN to the width of the box that LaTeX gets on
typesetting the TEXT argument.  The length name ‘\LEN’ has to be a
control sequence (*note Control sequences::), and as such must begin
with a backslash, ‘\’ under normal circumstances.

   This prints the width of the lowercase ASCII alphabet.

     \newlength{\alphabetwidth}
     \settowidth{\alphabetwidth}{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}
     \the\alphabetwidth

   If no such length \LEN has been declared with ‘\newlength’, if for
example you mistype the above as ‘\settowidth{\aplhabetwidth}{abc...}’,
then you get something like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument>
\aplhabetwidth’.  If you leave the backslash out of \LEN, as in
‘\settoheight{alphabetwidth}{...}’ then you get something like ‘Missing

14.7 ‘\stretch’
===============

Synopsis:

     \stretch{NUMBER}

   Produces a rubber length with zero natural length and NUMBER times
‘\fill’ units of stretchability (*note Lengths::).  The NUMBER can be
positive or negative.  This command is robust (*note \protect::).

   It works for both vertical and horizontal spacing.  In this
horizontal example, LaTeX produces three tick marks, and the distance
between the first and second is half again as long as the distance
between the second and third.

     \rule{0.4pt}{1ex}\hspace{\stretch{1.5}}%
       \rule{0.4pt}{1ex}\hspace{\stretch{1}}%
       \rule{0.4pt}{1ex}

   In this vertical example, the ‘We dedicate ...’ will have three times
as much space under it as above it.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Expressions,  Prev: \stretch,  Up: Lengths

14.8 Expressions
================

Synopsis, one of:

     \numexpr EXPRESSION
     \dimexpr EXPRESSION
     \glueexpr EXPRESSION
     \muglue EXPRESSION

   Any place where you may write an integer, or a TeX dimen, or TeX
glue, or muglue, you can instead write an expression to compute that
type of quantity.

   An example is that ‘\the\dimexpr\linewidth-4pt\relax’ will produce as
output the length that is four points less than width of a line (the
only purpose of ‘\the’ is to show the result in the document).
Analogously, ‘\romannumeral\numexpr6+3\relax’ will produce ‘ix’, and
‘\the\glueexpr 5pt plus 1pt * 2 \relax’ will produce ‘10.0pt plus
2.0pt’.

   A convenience here over doing calculations by allocating registers
and then using ‘\advance’, etc., is that the evaluation of expressions
does not involve assignments and can therefore be performed in places
where assignments are not allowed.  The next example computes the width
of the ‘\parbox’.

     \newlength{\offset}\setlength{\offset}{2em}
     \begin{center}
     \parbox{\dimexpr\linewidth-\offset*3}{With malice toward none
     with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see
     the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the
     nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and
     for his widow and his orphan \textasciitilde\ to do all which may
     achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with
     all nations.  ---Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, from the
     memorial}
     \end{center}

   The EXPRESSION consists of one or more terms of the same type
(integer, dimension, etc.)  that are added or subtracted.  A term that
is a type of number, dimension, etc., consists of a factor of that type,
optionally multiplied or divided by factors.  A factor of a type is
either a quantity of that type or a parenthesized subexpression.  The
expression produces a result of the given type, so that ‘\numexpr’
produces an integer, ‘\dimexpr’ produces a dimension, etc.

   In the quotation example above, changing to
‘\dimexpr\linewidth-3*\offset’ gives the error ‘Illegal unit of measure
(pt inserted)’.  This is because for ‘\dimexpr’ and ‘\glueexpr’, the
input consists of a dimension or glue value followed by an optional
multiplication factor, and not the other way around.  Thus ‘\the\dimexpr
1pt*10\relax’ is valid and produces ‘10.0pt’, but ‘\the\dimexpr
10*1pt\relax’ gives the ‘Illegal unit’ error.

   The expressions absorb tokens and carry out appropriate mathematics
up to a ‘\relax’ (which will be absorbed), or up to the first non-valid
token.  Thus, ‘\the\numexpr2+3px’ will print ‘5px’, because LaTeX reads
the ‘\numexpr2+3’, which is made up of numbers, and then finds the
letter ‘p’, which cannot be part of a number.  It therefore terminates
the expression and produces the ‘5’, followed by the regular text ‘px’.

   This termination behavior is useful in comparisons.  In
‘\ifnum\numexpr\parindent*2 < 10pt Yes\else No\fi’, the less than sign
terminates the expression and the result is ‘No’ (in a standard LaTeX
article).

   Expressions may use the operators ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’ and ‘/’ along with
parentheses for subexpressions, ‘(...)’.  In glue expressions the ‘plus’
and ‘minus’ parts do not need parentheses to be affected by a factor.
So ‘\the\glueexpr 5pt plus 1pt * 2 \relax’ results in ‘10pt plus 2pt’.

   TeX will coerce other numerical types in the same way as it does when
doing register assignment.  Thus ‘\the\numexpr\dimexpr 1pt\relax\relax’
will result in ‘65536’, which is ‘1pt’ converted to scaled points (*note
‘sp’: units of length sp, TeX's internal unit) and then coerced into an
integer.  With a ‘\glueexpr’ here, the stretch and shrink would be
dropped.  Going the other way, a ‘\numexpr’ inside a ‘\dimexpr’ or
‘\glueexpr’ will need appropriate units, as in ‘\the\dimexpr\numexpr 1 +
2\relax pt\relax’, which produces ‘3.0pt’.

   The details of the arithmetic: each factor is checked to be in the
allowed range, numbers must be less than 2^{31} in absolute value, and
dimensions or glue components must be less than 2^{14} points, or ‘mu’,
or ‘fil’, etc.  The arithmetic operations are performed individually,
except for a scaling operation (a multiplication immediately followed by
a division) which is done as one combined operation with a 64-bit
product as intermediate value.  The result of each operation is again
checked to be in the allowed range.

   Finally, division and scaling take place with rounding (unlike TeX's
‘\divide’, which truncates).  Thus ‘\the\dimexpr 5pt*(3/2)\relax’ puts
‘10.0pt’ in the document, because it rounds ‘3/2’ to ‘2’, while
‘\the\dimexpr 5pt*(4/3)\relax’ produces ‘5.0pt’.

To start a paragraph, just type some text.  To end the current

of which is made by two empty lines.

     It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
     of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

     However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
     first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
     of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
     of some one or other of their daughters.

     ``My dear Mr. Bennet,'' said his lady to him one day,
     ``have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?''

   A paragraph separator can be made of a sequence of at least one blank
line, at least one of which is not terminated by a comment.  A blank
line is a line that is empty or made only of blank characters such as
space or tab.  Comments in source code are started with a ‘%’ and span
up to the end of line.  In the following example the two columns are
identical:

     \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
     \begin{document}
     First paragraph.

     Second paragraph.
     \newpage
     First paragraph.

       % separator lines may contain blank characters.

     Second paragraph.
     \end{document}

   Once LaTeX has gathered all of a paragraph's contents it divides that
content into lines in a way that is optimized over the entire paragraph
(*note Line breaking::).

   There are places where a new paragraph is not permitted.  Don't put a
blank line in math mode (*note Modes::); here the blank line before the
‘\end{equation}’

     \begin{equation}
       2^{|S|} > |S|

     \end{equation}

will get you the error ‘Missing $ inserted’.  Similarly, the blank line
in this ‘\section’ argument

     \section{aaa

     bbb}

gets ‘Runaway argument? {aaa ! Paragraph ended before \@sect was
complete’.

* Menu:

* \par::                     End the current paragraph.

15.1 ‘\par’
===========

Synopsis (note that while reading the input TeX converts any sequence of
one or more blank lines to a ‘\par’, *note Making paragraphs::):

     \par

   End the current paragraph.  The usual way to separate paragraphs is
with a blank line but the ‘\par’ command is entirely equivalent.  This
command is robust (*note \protect::).

   This example uses ‘\par’ rather than a blank line simply for
readability.

     \newcommand{\syllabusLegalese}{%
       \whatCheatingIs\par\whatHappensWhenICatchYou}

   In LR mode the ‘\par’ command does nothing and is ignored.  In
paragraph mode, the ‘\par’ command terminates paragraph mode, switching
LaTeX to vertical mode (*note Modes::).

   You cannot use the ‘\par’ command in a math mode.  You also cannot
use it in the argument of many commands, such as the sectioning
commands, e.g. ‘\section’ (*note Making paragraphs:: and *note
\newcommand & \renewcommand::).

   The ‘\par’ command is not the same as the ‘\paragraph’ command.  The
latter is, like ‘\section’ or ‘\subsection’, a sectioning command used
by the LaTeX document standard classes (*note \subsubsection &
\paragraph & \subparagraph::).

   The ‘\par’ command is not the same as ‘\newline’ or the line break
double backslash, ‘\\’.  The difference is that ‘\par’ ends the
paragraph, not just the line, and also triggers the addition of the
between-paragraph vertical space ‘\parskip’ (*note \parindent &
\parskip::).

   The output from this example

     xyz

     \setlength{\parindent}{3in}
     \setlength{\parskip}{5in}
     \noindent test\indent test1\par test2

is: after ‘xyz’ there is a vertical skip of 5 inches and then ‘test’
appears, aligned with the left margin.  On the same line, there is an
empty horizontal space of 3 inches and then ‘test1’ appears.  Finally.
there is a vertical space of 5 inches, followed by a fresh paragraph
with a paragraph indent of 3 inches, and then LaTeX puts the text
‘test2’.

15.2 ‘\indent’ & ‘\noindent’
============================

Synopsis:

     \indent

or

     \noindent

   Go into horizontal mode (*note Modes::).  The ‘\indent’ command first
outputs an empty box whose width is ‘\parindent’.  These commands are
robust (*note \protect::).

   Ordinarily you create a new paragraph by putting in a blank line.
*Note \par::, for the difference between this command and ‘\par’.  To
start a paragraph without an indent, or to continue an interrupted
paragraph, use ‘\noindent’.

   In the middle of a paragraph the ‘\noindent’ command has no effect,
because LaTeX is already in horizontal mode there.  The ‘\indent’
command's only effect is to output a space.

   This example starts a fresh paragraph.

     ... end of the prior paragraph.

     \noindent This paragraph is not indented.

and this continues an interrupted paragraph.

     The data

     \begin{center}
       \begin{tabular}{rl} ... \end{tabular}
     \end{center}

     \noindent shows this clearly.

   To omit indentation in the entire document put
‘\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}’ in the preamble.  If you do that, you may
want to also set the length of spaces between paragraphs, ‘\parskip’
(*note \parindent & \parskip::).

   Default LaTeX styles have the first paragraph after a section that is
not indented, as is traditional typesetting in English.  To change that,
look on CTAN for the package ‘indentfirst’.

15.3 ‘\parindent’ & ‘\parskip’
==============================

Synopsis:

     \setlength{\parindent}{HORIZONTAL LEN}
     \setlength{\parskip}{VERTICAL LEN}

   Both are rubber lengths (*note Lengths::).  They affect the
indentation of ordinary paragraphs, not paragraphs inside minipages
(*note minipage::), and the vertical space between paragraphs,
respectively.

   For example, if this is put in the preamble:

     \setlength{\parindent}{0em}
     \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

The document will have paragraphs that are not indented, but instead are
vertically separated by about the height of a lowercase ‘x’.

   In LaTeX standard class documents, the default value for ‘\parindent’
in one-column documents is ‘15pt’ when the default text size is ‘10pt’,
‘17pt’ for ‘11pt’, and ‘1.5em’ for ‘12pt’.  In two-column documents it
is ‘1em’.  (These values are set before LaTeX calls ‘\normalfont’ so
‘em’ is derived from the default font, Computer Modern.  If you use a
different font then to set ‘\parindent’ to 1em matching that font, put
‘\AtBeginDocument{\setlength{\parindent}{1em}}’ in the preamble.)

   The default value for ‘\parskip’ in LaTeX's standard document classes
is ‘0pt plus1pt’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Marginal notes,  Prev: \parindent & \parskip,  Up: Making paragraphs

15.4 Marginal notes
===================

Synopsis, one of:

     \marginpar{RIGHT}
     \marginpar[LEFT]{RIGHT}

   Create a note in the margin.  The first line of the note will have
the same baseline as the line in the text where the ‘\marginpar’ occurs.

   The margin that LaTeX uses for the note depends on the current layout
(*note Document class options::) and also on ‘\reversemarginpar’ (see
below).  If you are using one-sided layout (document option ‘oneside’)
then it goes in the right margin.  If you are using two-sided layout
(document option ‘twoside’) then it goes in the outside margin.  If you
are in two-column layout (document option ‘twocolumn’) then it goes in
the nearest margin.

   If you declare ‘\reversemarginpar’ then LaTeX will place subsequent
marginal notes in the opposite margin to that given in the prior
paragraph.  Revert that to the default position with ‘\normalmarginpar’.

   When you specify the optional argument LEFT then it is used for a
note in the left margin, while the mandatory argument RIGHT is used for
a note in the right margin.

   Normally, a note's first word will not be hyphenated.  You can enable
hyphenation there by beginning LEFT or RIGHT with ‘\hspace{0pt}’.

   These parameters affect the formatting of the note:

‘\marginparpush’
     Minimum vertical space between notes; default ‘7pt’ for ‘12pt’
     documents, ‘5pt’ else.  See also *note page layout parameters
     marginparpush::.

‘\marginparsep’
     Horizontal space between the main text and the note; default ‘11pt’
     for ‘10pt’ documents, ‘10pt’ else.

‘\marginparwidth’
     Width of the note itself; default for a one-sided ‘10pt’ document
     is ‘90pt’, ‘83pt’ for ‘11pt’, and ‘68pt’ for ‘12pt’; ‘17pt’ more in
     each case for a two-sided document.  In two column mode, the
     default is ‘48pt’.

   The standard LaTeX routine for marginal notes does not prevent notes
from falling off the bottom of the page.

16 Math formulas
****************

Produce mathematical text by putting LaTeX into math mode or display
math mode (*note Modes::).  This example shows both.

     The wave equation for \( u \) is
     \begin{displaymath}
       \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} = c^2\nabla^2u
     \end{displaymath}
     where \( \nabla^2 \) is the spatial Laplacian and \( c \) is constant.

Math mode is for inline mathematics.  In the above example it is invoked
by the starting ‘\(’ and finished by the matching ending ‘\)’.  Display
math mode is for displayed equations and here is invoked by the
‘displaymath’ environment.  Note that any mathematical text whatever,
including mathematical text consisting of just one character, is handled
in math mode.

   When in math mode or display math mode, LaTeX handles many aspects of
your input text differently than in other text modes.  For example,

     contrast x+y with \( x+y \)

in math mode the letters are in italics and the spacing around the plus
sign is different.

   There are three ways to make inline formulas, to put LaTeX in math
mode.

     \( MATHEMATICAL MATERIAL \)
     $ MATHEMATICAL MATERIAL $
     \begin{math} MATHEMATICAL MATERIAL \end{math}

The first form is preferred and the second is quite common, but the
third form is rarely used.  You can sometimes use one and sometimes
another, as in ‘\(x\) and $y$’.  You can use these in paragraph mode or
in LR mode (*note Modes::).

   To make displayed formulas, put LaTeX into display math mode with
either:

     \begin{displaymath}
       MATHEMATICAL MATERIAL
     \end{displaymath}

or

     \begin{equation}
       MATHEMATICAL MATERIAL
     \end{equation}

(*note displaymath::, *note equation::).  The only difference is that
with the ‘equation’ environment, LaTeX puts a formula number alongside
the formula.  The construct ‘\[ MATH \]’ is equivalent to
‘\begin{displaymath} MATH \end{displaymath}’.  These environments can
only be used in paragraph mode (*note Modes::).

   The American Mathematical Society has made freely available a set of
packages that greatly expand your options for writing mathematics,
‘amsmath’ and ‘amssymb’ (also be aware of the ‘mathtools’ package that
is an extension to, and loads, ‘amsmath’).  New documents that will have
mathematical text should use these packages.  Descriptions of these
packages is outside the scope of this document; see their documentation
on CTAN.

16.1 Subscripts & superscripts
==============================

Synopsis (in math mode or display math mode), one of:

     BASE^EXP
     BASE^{EXP}

or, one of:

     BASE_EXP
     BASE_{EXP}

   Make EXP appear as a superscript of BASE (with the caret
character, ‘^’) or a subscript (with underscore, ‘_’).

   In this example the ‘0’'s and ‘1’'s are subscripts while the ‘2’'s
are superscripts.

     \( (x_0+x_1)^2 \leq (x_0)^2+(x_1)^2 \)

   To have the subscript or superscript contain more than one character,
surround the expression with curly braces, as in ‘e^{-2x}’.  This
example's fourth line shows curly braces used to group an expression for
the exponent.

     \begin{displaymath}
       (3^3)^3=27^3=19\,683
       \qquad
       3^{(3^3)}=3^{27}=7\,625\,597\,484\,987
     \end{displaymath}

   LaTeX knows how to handle a superscript on a superscript, or a
subscript on a subscript, or supers on subs, or subs on supers.  So,
expressions such as ‘e^{x^2}’ and ‘x_{i_0}’ give correct output.  Note
the use in those expressions of curly braces to give the BASE a
determined EXP.  If you enter ‘\(3^3^3\)’, this interpreted as
‘\(3^{3}^{3}\)’ and then you get TeX error ‘Double superscript’.

   LaTeX does the right thing when something has both a subscript and a
superscript.  In this example the integral has both.  They come out in
the correct place without any author intervention.

     \begin{displaymath}
       \int_{x=a}^b f'(x)\,dx = f(b)-f(a)
     \end{displaymath}

Note the curly braces around ‘x=a’ to make the entire expression a
subscript.

   To put a superscript or subscript before a symbol, use a construct
like ‘{}_t K^2’.  The empty curly braces ‘{}’ give the subscript
something to attach to and keeps it from accidentally attaching to a
prior symbols.

   Using the subscript or superscript character outside of math mode or
display math mode, as in ‘the expression x^2’, will get you the TeX
error ‘Missing $ inserted’.

   A common reason to want subscripts outside of a mathematics mode is
to typeset chemical formulas.  There are packages for that, such as
‘mhchem’; see CTAN.

16.2 Math symbols
=================

LaTeX provides almost any mathematical or technical symbol that anyone
uses.  For example, if you include ‘$\pi$’ in your source, you will get
the pi symbol π.  See the "Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List" package at
<https://ctan.org/pkg/comprehensive>.

   Here is a list of commonly-used symbols.  It is by no means
exhaustive.  Each symbol is described with a short phrase, and its
symbol class, which determines the spacing around it, is given in
parenthesis.  Unless said otherwise, the commands for these symbols can
be used only in math mode.  To redefine a command so that it can be used
whatever the current mode, see *note \ensuremath::.

     Similar: ‘\vert’ and ‘|’ produce the same single-line vertical bar
     symbol but without any spacing (they fall in class ordinary) and
     you should not use them as relations but instead only as ordinals,
     i.e., footnote symbols.  For absolute value, see the entry
     for ‘\vert’ and for norm see the entry for ‘\Vert’.

‘\models’

     Synonym: ‘\owns’.  Similar: is a member of ‘\in’.

‘\not’
         Long solidus, or slash, used to overstrike a following operator
     (relation).

     Many negated operators are available that don't require ‘\not’,
     particularly with the ‘amssymb’ package.  For example, ‘\notin’ is
     typographically preferable to ‘\not\in’.

‘\notin’

     the desired symbol, that is, the same result as
     ‘$f^{\prime\prime\prime}$’, but uses rather less typing.  You can
     only use ‘\prime’ in math mode.  Using the right single quote ‘'’
     in text mode produces a different character (apostrophe).

16.2.2 ‘\boldmath’ & ‘\unboldmath’
----------------------------------

Synopsis (used in paragraph mode or LR mode):

     \boldmath \( MATH \)

or

     \unboldmath \( MATH \)

   Declarations to change the letters and symbols in MATH to be in a
bold font, or to countermand that and bring back the regular (non-bold)
default, respectively.  They must be used when _not_ in math mode or
display math mode (*note Modes::).  Both commands are fragile (*note
\protect::).

   In this example each ‘\boldmath’ command takes place inside an
‘\mbox’,

     we have $\mbox{\boldmath \( v \)} = 5\cdot\mbox{\boldmath \( u \)$}$

which means ‘\boldmath’ is only called in a text mode, here LR mode, and
explains why we must switch LaTeX into math mode to set ‘v’ and ‘u’.

   If you use either command inside math mode, as with ‘Trouble: \(
\boldmath x \)’, then you get something like ‘LaTeX Font Warning:
Command \boldmath invalid in math mode’ and ‘LaTeX Font Warning: Command
\mathversion invalid in math mode’.

16.2.2.1 ‘bm’: Individual bold math symbols
...........................................

Specifying ‘\boldmath’ is the best method for typesetting a whole math
expression in bold.  But to typeset individual symbols within an
expression in bold, the ‘bm’ package provided by the LaTeX Project team
is better.  Its usage is outside the scope of this document (see its
documentation at <https://ctan.org/pkg/bm> or in your installation) but
the spacing in the output of this small example will show that it is an
improvement over ‘\boldmath’ within an expression:

     \usepackage{bm}   % in preamble
     ...
     we have $\bm{v} = 5\cdot\bm{u}$


File: latex2e.info,  Node: OpenType bold math,  Prev: bm,  Up: \boldmath & \unboldmath

16.2.2.2 OpenType bold math
...........................

Unfortunately, when using the Unicode engines (XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX),
neither ‘\boldmath’ nor ‘bm’ usually work well, because the OpenType
math fonts normally used with those engines rarely come with a bold
companion, and both ‘\boldmath’ and ‘bm’ require this.  (The
implementation of ‘bm’ relies on ‘\boldmath’, so the requirements are
the same.)  If you do have a bold math font, though, then ‘\boldmath’
and ‘bm’ work fine.

   If no such font is available, one alternative is to construct fake
bold fonts with the ‘fontspec’ package's ‘FakeBold=1’ parameter (see its
documentation, <https://ctan.org/pkg/fontspec>).  This may be acceptable
for drafting or informal distribution, but the results are far from a
true bold font.

   Another alternative to handling bold for OpenType math fonts is to
use the ‘\symbf’ (bold), ‘\symbfit’ (bold italic), and related commands
from the ‘unicode-math’ package.  These do not change the current font,
but rather change the (Unicode) "alphabet" used, which in practice is
more widely supported than a separate bold font.  Many variations are
possible, and so there are subtleties to getting the desired output.  As
usual, see the package documentation
(<https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math>).

16.2.3 Blackboard bold
----------------------

Synopsis:

     \usepackage{amssymb}   % in preamble
       ...
     \mathbb{UPPERCASE-LETTER}

   Provide blackboard bold symbols, sometimes also known as doublestruck
letters, used to denote number sets such as the natural numbers, the
integers, etc.

   Here

     \( \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n^2 \geq 0 \)

the ‘\mathbb{N}’ gives blackboard bold symbol ℕ, representing the
natural numbers.

   If the argument contains something other than an uppercase letter,
you do not get an error but you do get strange results, including
unexpected characters.

   There are packages that give access to symbols other than just the
capital letters; look on CTAN.

Synopsis:

     \mathcal{UPPERCASE-LETTERS}

   Use a script-like font.

   In this example the graph identifier is output in a cursive font.

     Let the graph be \( \mathcal{G} \).

   If you use something other than an uppercase letter then you do not
get an error but you also do not get math calligraphic output.  For
instance, ‘\mathcal{g}’ outputs a close curly brace symbol.

16.2.5 Delimiters
-----------------

Delimiters are parentheses, braces, or other characters used to mark the
start and end of subformulas.  This formula has three sets of
parentheses delimiting the three subformulas.

     (z-z_0)^2 = (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2

The delimiters do not need to match, so you can enter ‘\( [0,1) \)’.

   Here are the common delimiters:

DelimiterCommand        Name
------------------------------------------------------
(        ‘(’            Left parenthesis
)        ‘)’            Right parenthesis
\}       ‘{’ or         Left brace
         ‘\lbrace’
\{       ‘}’ or         Right brace
         ‘\rbrace’
[        ‘[’ or         Left bracket
         ‘\lbrack’
]        ‘]’ or         Right bracket
         ‘\rbrack’
⌊        ‘\lfloor’      Left floor bracket
⌋        ‘\rfloor’      Right floor bracket
⌈        ‘\lceil’       Left ceiling bracket
⌉        ‘\rceil’       Right ceiling bracket
⟨        ‘\langle’      Left angle bracket
⟩        ‘\rangle’      Right angle bracket
/        ‘/’            Slash, or forward slash
\        ‘\backslash’   Reverse slash, or backslash
|        ‘|’ or         Vertical bar
         ‘\vert’
‖        ‘\|’ or        Double vertical bar
         ‘\Vert’

   The ‘mathtools’ package allows you to create commands for paired
delimiters.  For instance, if you put
‘\DeclarePairedDelimiter\abs{\lvert}{\rvert}’ in your preamble then you
get two commands for single-line vertical bars (they only work in math
mode).  The starred form, such as ‘\abs*{\frac{22}{7}}’, has the height
of the vertical bars match the height of the argument.  The unstarred
form, such as ‘\abs{\frac{22}{7}}’, has the bars fixed at a default
height.  This form accepts an optional argument, as in ‘\abs[SIZE
COMMAND]{\frac{22}{7}}’, where the height of the bars is given in SIZE
COMMAND, such as ‘\Bigg’.  Using instead ‘\lVert’ and ‘\rVert’ as the
symbols will give you a norm symbol with the same behavior.

       \end{array}\right)
     \end{equation}

   *Note Delimiters::, for a list of the common delimiters.

   Every ‘\left’ must have a matching ‘\right’.  In the above example,
leaving out the ‘\left(’ gets the error message ‘Extra \right’.  Leaving
out the ‘\right)’ gets ‘You can't use `\eqno' in math mode’.

   However, DELIMITER1 and DELIMITER2 need not match.  A common case is
that you want an unmatched brace, as below.  Use a period, ‘.’, as a
“null delimiter”.

     \begin{equation}
       f(n)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                     1             &\mbox{--if \(n=0\)} \\
                     f(n-1)+3n^2   &\mbox{--else}
            \end{array}\right.
     \end{equation}

Note that to get a curly brace as a delimiter you must prefix it with a
backslash, ‘\{’ (*note Reserved characters::).  (The packages ‘amsmath’
and ‘mathtools’ allow you to get the above construct through in a
‘cases’ environment.)

   The ‘\left ... \right’ pair make a group.  One consequence is that
the formula enclosed in the ‘\left ... \right’ pair cannot have line
breaks in the output.  This includes both manual line breaks and
LaTeX-generated automatic ones.  In this example, LaTeX breaks the
equation to make the formula fit the margins.

     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
     \( (a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m+n+o+p+q+r+s+t+u+v+w+x+y+z) \)

But with ‘\left’ and ‘\right’

     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
     \( \left(a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m+n+o+p+q+r+s+t+u+v+w+x+y+z\right) \)

LaTeX won't break the line, causing the formula to extend into the
margin.

   Because ‘\left ... \right’ make a group, all the usual grouping rules
hold.  Here, the value of ‘\testlength’ set inside the equation will be
forgotten, and the output is ‘1.2pt’.

     \newlength{\testlength} \setlength{\testlength}{1.2pt}
     \begin{equation}
       \left( a+b=c \setlength{\testlength}{3.4pt} \right)
       \the\testlength
     \end{equation}

   The ‘\left ... \right’ pair affect the horizontal spacing of the
enclosed formula, in two ways.  The first is that in ‘\( \sin(x) =
\sin\left(x\right) \)’ the one after the equals sign has more space
around the ‘x’.  That's because ‘\left( ... \right)’ inserts an inner
node while ‘( ... )’ inserts an opening node.  The second way that the
pair affect the horizontal spacing is that because they form a group,
the enclosed subformula will be typeset at its natural width, with no
stretching or shrinking to make the line fit better.

   TeX scales the delimiters according to the height and depth of the
enclosed formula.  Here LaTeX grows the brackets to extend the full
height of the integral.

     \begin{equation}
       \left[ \int_{x=r_0}^{\infty} -G\frac{Mm}{r^2}\, dr \right]
     \end{equation}

   Manual sizing is often better.  For instance, although below the rule
has no depth, TeX will create delimiters that extend far below the rule.

     \begin{equation}
       \left( \rule{1pt}{1cm} \right)
     \end{equation}

TeX can choose delimiters that are too small, as in ‘\( \left| |x|+|y|
\right| \)’.  It can also choose delimiters that are too large, as here.

     \begin{equation}
       \left( \sum_{0\leq i<n} i^k \right)
     \end{equation}

A third awkward case is when a long displayed formula is on more than
one line and you must match the sizes of the opening and closing
delimiter; you can't use ‘\left’ on the first line and ‘\right’ on the
last because they must be paired.

   To size the delimiters manually, see *note \bigl & \bigr etc.::.

16.2.5.2 ‘\bigl’, ‘\bigr’, etc.
...............................

Synopsis, one of:

     \bigl DELIMITER1 ... \bigr DELIMITER2
     \Bigl DELIMITER1 ... \bigr DELIMITER2
     \biggl DELIMITER1 ... \biggr DELIMITER2
     \Biggl DELIMITER1 ... \Biggr DELIMITER2

(as with ‘\bigl[...\bigr]’; strictly speaking they need not be paired,
see below), or one of:

     \bigm DELIMITER
     \Bigm DELIMITER
     \biggm DELIMITER
     \Biggm DELIMITER

(as with ‘\bigm|’), or one of:

     \big DELIMITER
     \Big DELIMITER
     \bigg DELIMITER
     \Bigg DELIMITER

(as with ‘\big[’).

   Produce manually-sized delimiters.  For delimiters that are
automatically sized see *note \left & \right::).

   This produces slightly larger outer vertical bars.

       \bigl| |x|+|y| \bigr|

   The commands above are listed in order of increasing size.  You can
use the smallest size such as ‘\bigl...\bigr’ in a paragraph without
causing LaTeX to spread the lines apart.  The larger sizes are meant for
displayed equations.

   *Note Delimiters::, for a list of the common delimiters.  In the
family of commands with ‘l’ or ‘r’, DELIMITER1 and DELIMITER2 need not
match together.

   The ‘l’ and ‘r’ commands produce open and close delimiters that
insert no horizontal space between a preceding atom and the delimiter,
while the commands without ‘l’ and ‘r’ insert some space (because each
delimiter is set as an ordinary variable).  Compare these two.

     \begin{tabular}{l}
       \(\displaystyle \sin\biggl(\frac{1}{2}\biggr) \)  \\  % good
       \(\displaystyle \sin\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)  \)   \\  % bad
     \end{tabular}

The traditional typographic treatment is on the first line.  On the
second line the output will have some extra space between the ‘\sin’ and
the open parenthesis.

   Commands without ‘l’ or ‘r’ do give correct spacing in some
circumstances, as with this large vertical line

     \begin{equation}
       \int_{x=a}^b x^2\,dx = \frac{1}{3} x^3 \Big|_{x=a}^b
     \end{equation}

(many authors would replace ‘\frac’ with the ‘\tfrac’ command from the
‘amsmath’ package), and as with this larger slash.

     \begin{equation}
       \lim_{n\to\infty}\pi(n) \big/ (n/\log n) = 1
     \end{equation}

   Unlike the ‘\left...\right’ pair (*note \left & \right::), the
commands here with ‘l’ or ‘r’ do not make a group.  Strictly speaking
they need not be matched so you can write something like this.

     \begin{equation}
       \Biggl[ \pi/6 ]
     \end{equation}

   The commands with ‘m’ are for relations, which are in the middle of
formulas, as here.

     \begin{equation}
       \biggl\{ a\in B \biggm| a=\sum_{0\leq i<n}3i^2+4 \biggr\}
     \end{equation}

16.2.6 Dots, horizontal or vertical
-----------------------------------

Ellipses are the three dots (usually three) indicating that a pattern
continues.

     \begin{array}{cccc}
       a_{0,0}    &a_{0,1}   &a_{0,2} &\ldots \\
       a_{1,0}    &\ddots                     \\
       \vdots
     \end{array}

   LaTeX provides these.

‘\cdots’
     Horizontal ellipsis with the dots raised to the center of the line,
     as in ⋯.  Used as: ‘\( a_0\cdot a_1\cdots a_{n-1} \)’.

‘\ddots’
     Diagonal ellipsis, ⋱.  See the above array example for a usage.

‘\ldots’
‘\mathellipsis’
‘\dots’
     Ellipsis on the baseline, ….  Used as: ‘\( x_0,\ldots x_{n-1} \)’.
     Another example is the above array example.  Synonyms are
     ‘\mathellipsis’ and ‘\dots’.  A synonym from the ‘amsmath’ package
     is ‘\hdots’.

     You can also use this command outside of mathematical text, as in
     ‘The gears, brakes, \ldots{} are all broken’.

‘\vdots’
     Vertical ellipsis, ⋮.  See the above array example for a usage.

   The ‘amsmath’ package has the command ‘\dots’ to semantically mark up
ellipses.  This example produces two different-looking outputs for the
first two uses of the ‘\dots’ command.

     \usepackage{amsmath}  % in preamble
       ...
     Suppose that \( p_0, p_1, \dots, p_{n-1} \) lists all of the primes.
     Observe that \( p_0\cdot p_1 \dots \cdot p_{n-1} +1 \) is not a
       multiple of any \( p_i \).
     Conclusion: there are infinitely many primes \( p_0, p_1, \dotsc \).

In the first line LaTeX looks to the comma following ‘\dots’ to
determine that it should output an ellipsis on the baseline.  The second
line has a ‘\cdot’ following ‘\dots’ so LaTeX outputs an ellipsis that
is on the math axis, vertically centered.  However, the third usage has
no follow-on character so you have to tell LaTeX what to do.  You can
use one of the commands: ‘\dotsc’ if you need the ellipsis appropriate
for a comma following, ‘\dotsb’ if you need the ellipses that fits when
the dots are followed by a binary operator or relation symbol, ‘\dotsi’
for dots with integrals, or ‘\dotso’ for others.

   The ‘\dots’ command from ‘amsmath’ differs from the LaTeX kernel's
‘\dots’ command in another way: it outputs a thin space after the
ellipsis.  Furthermore, the ‘unicode-math’ package automatically loads
‘amsmath’, so ‘amsmath’'s ‘\dots’ may be active even when you did not
explicitly load it, thus changing the output from ‘\dots’ in both text
and math mode.

   Yet more about the ellipsis commands: when running under Unicode
engines (‘lualatex’, ‘xelatex’), LaTeX will use the Unicode ellipsis
character (U+2026) in the font if it's available; under traditional TeX
engines (‘pdflatex’, ‘latex’), it will typeset three spaced periods.
Generally, the Unicode single-character ellipsis has almost no space
between the three periods, while the spacing of the non-Unicode ellipsis
is looser, more in accordance with traditional typography.

   For omicron, if you are using LaTeX's default Computer Modern font
then enter omicron just as ‘o’ or ‘O’.  If you like having the name or
if your font shows a difference then you can use something like
‘\newcommand\omicron{o}’.  The package ‘unicode-math’ has ‘\upomicron’
for upright omicron and ‘\mitomicron’ for math italic.

   While the set membership relation symbol ∈ generated by ‘\in’ is
related to epsilon, it is never used for a variable.

prints as ‘id’.  The starred form ‘\DeclareMathOperator*{\op}{op}’ sets
any superscript or subscript to be above and below, as is traditional
with ‘\lim’, ‘\sup’, or ‘\max’.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Over- or under math,  Next: Spacing in math mode,  Prev: Math accents,  Up: Math formulas

16.5 Over- or under math
========================

LaTeX provides commands for putting lines, braces, and arrows over or
under math material.

‘\underline{MATH}’
     Underline MATH.  For example: ‘\underline{x+y}’.  The line is
     always completely below the text, taking account of descenders, so
     in ‘\(\underline{y}\)’ the line is lower than in
     ‘\(\underline{x}\)’.  As of approximately 2019, this command and
     others in this section are robust; before that, they were fragile
     (*note \protect::).

     The package ‘ulem’ (<https://ctan.org/pkg/uelem>) does text mode
     underlining and allows line breaking as well as a number of other
     features.  See also *note \hrulefill & \dotfill:: for producing a
     line for such things as a signature or placeholder.

‘\overline{MATH}’
     Put a horizontal line over MATH.  For example: ‘\overline{x+y}’.
     This differs from the accent command ‘\bar’ (*note Math accents::).

‘\underbrace{MATH}’
     Put a brace under MATH.  For example:
     ‘(1-\underbrace{1/2)+(1/2}-1/3)’.

     You can attach text to the brace as a subscript (‘_’) or
     superscript (‘^’) as here:

          \begin{displaymath}
            1+1/2+\underbrace{1/3+1/4}_{>1/2}+
                 \underbrace{1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8}_{>1/2}+\cdots
          \end{displaymath}

     The superscript appears on top of the expression, and so can look
     unconnected to the underbrace.

‘\overbrace{MATH}’
     Put a brace over MATH.  For example:
     ‘\overbrace{x+x+\cdots+x}^{\mbox{\(k\) times}}’.

‘\overrightarrow{MATH}’
     Put a right arrow over MATH.  For example: ‘\overrightarrow{x+y}’.

‘\overleftarrow{MATH}’
     Put a left arrow over MATH.  For example: ‘\overleftarrow{a+b}’.

   The package ‘mathtools’ (<https://ctan.org/pkg/mathtools>) adds an
over- and underbracket, as well as some improvements on the braces.

16.6 Spacing in math mode
=========================

When typesetting mathematics, LaTeX puts in spacing according to the
normal rules for mathematics texts.  If you enter ‘y=m x’ then LaTeX
ignores the space and in the output the m is next to the x, as y=mx.

   But LaTeX's rules occasionally need tweaking.  For example, in an
integral the tradition is to put a small extra space between the ‘f(x)’
and the ‘dx’, here done with the ‘\,’ command:

     \int_0^1 f(x)\,dx

   LaTeX provides the commands that follow for use in math mode.  Many
of these spacing definitions are expressed in terms of the math unit
“mu”.  It is defined as 1/18em, where the em is taken from the current
math symbols family (*note Units of length::).  Thus, a ‘\thickspace’ is
something like 5/18 times the width of a ‘M’.

‘\;’

     Synonym: ‘\thickspace’.  Normally ‘5.0mu plus 5.0mu’.  With the
     ‘amsmath’ package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, can be
     used in text mode as well as math mode; otherwise, in math mode
     only.

‘\negthickspace’
     Normally ‘-5.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu’.  With the ‘amsmath’
     package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, can be used in text
     mode as well as math mode; otherwise, in math mode only.

‘\:’
‘\>’
     Synonym: ‘\medspace’.  Normally ‘4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu’.
     With the ‘amsmath’ package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release,
     can be used in text mode as well as math mode; before that, in math
     mode only.

‘\negmedspace’
     Normally ‘-4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu’.  With the ‘amsmath’
     package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, can be used in text
     mode as well as math mode; before that, in math mode only.

‘\,’
     Synonym: ‘\thinspace’.  Normally ‘3mu’, which is 1/6em.  Can be
     used in both math mode and text mode (*note \thinspace &
     \negthinspace::).

     This space is widely used, for instance between the function and
     the infinitesimal in an integral ‘\int f(x)\,dx’ and, if an author
     does this, before punctuation in a displayed equation.

          The antiderivative is
          \begin{equation}
            3x^{-1/2}+3^{1/2}\,.
          \end{equation}

‘\!’
     Synonym: ‘\negthinspace’.  A negative thin space.  Normally ‘-3mu’.
     With the ‘amsmath’ package, or as of the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release,
     can be used in text mode as well as math mode; otherwise, the ‘\!’
     command is math mode only but the ‘\negthinspace’ command has
     always also worked in text mode (*note \thinspace &
     \negthinspace::).

‘\quad’
     This is 18mu, that is, 1em.  This is often used for space
     surrounding equations or expressions, for instance for the space
     between two equations inside a ‘displaymath’ environment.  It is
     available in both text and math mode.

‘\qquad’
     A length of 2 quads, that is, 36mu = 2em.  It is available in both
     text and math mode.

16.6.1 ‘\smash’
---------------

Synopsis:

     \smash{SUBFORMULA}

   Typeset SUBFORMULA as if its height and depth were zero.

   In this example the exponential is so tall that without the ‘\smash’
command LaTeX would separate its line from the line above it, and the
uneven line spacing might be unsightly.

     To compute the tetration $\smash{2^{2^{2^2}}}$,
     evaluate from the top down, as $2^{2^4}=2^{16}=65536$.

   (Because of the ‘\smash’ the printed expression could run into the
line above so you may want to wait until the final version of the
document to make such adjustments.)

   This pictures the effect of ‘\smash’ by using ‘\fbox’ to surround the
box that LaTeX will put on the line.  The ‘\blackbar’ command makes a
bar extending from 10 points below the baseline to 20 points above.

     \newcommand{\blackbar}{\rule[-10pt]{5pt}{30pt}}
     \fbox{\blackbar}
     \fbox{\smash{\blackbar}}

   The first box that LaTeX places is 20 points high and 10 points deep.
But the second box is treated by LaTeX as having zero height and zero
depth, despite that the ink printed on the page still extends well above
and below the line.

   The ‘\smash’ command appears often in mathematics to adjust the size
of an element that surrounds a subformula.  Here the first radical
extends below the baseline while the second lies just on the baseline.

     \begin{equation}
     \sqrt{\sum_{0\leq k< n} f(k)}
     \sqrt{\vphantom{\sum}\smash{\sum_{0\leq k< n}} f(k)}
     \end{equation}

   Note the use of ‘\vphantom’ to give the ‘\sqrt’ command an argument
with the height of the ‘\sum’ (*note \phantom & \vphantom &
\hphantom::).

   While most often used in mathematics, the ‘\smash’ command can appear
in other contexts.  However, it doesn't change into horizontal mode.  So
if it starts a paragraph then you should first put a ‘\leavevmode’, as
in the bottom line below.

     Text above.

     \smash{smashed, no indent}  % no paragraph indent

     \leavevmode\smash{smashed, with indent}  % usual paragraph indent

   The package ‘mathtools’ has operators that provide even finer control
over smashing a subformula box.

   The ‘\phantom’ command creates a box with the same height, depth, and
width as SUBFORMULA, but empty.  That is, this command causes LaTeX to
typeset the space but not fill it with the material.  Here LaTeX will
put a blank line that is the correct width for the answer, but will not
show that answer.

     \begin{displaymath}
       \int x^2\,dx=\mbox{\underline{$\phantom{(1/3)x^3+C}$}}
     \end{displaymath}

   The ‘\vphantom’ variant produces an invisible box with the same
vertical size as SUBFORMULA, the same height and depth, but having zero
width.  And ‘\hphantom’ makes a box with the same width as SUBFORMULA
but with zero height and depth.

   In this example, the tower of exponents in the second summand
expression is so tall that TeX places this expression further down than
its default.  Without adjustment, the two summand expressions would be
at different levels.  The ‘\vphantom’ in the first expression tells TeX
to leave as much vertical room as it does for the tower, so the two
expressions come out at the same level.

     \begin{displaymath}
         \sum_{j\in\{0,\ldots\, 10\}\vphantom{3^{3^{3^j}}}}
           \sum_{i\in\{0,\ldots\, 3^{3^{3^j}}\}} i\cdot j
     \end{displaymath}

   These commands are often used in conjunction with ‘\smash’.  *Note
\smash::, which includes another example of ‘\vphantom’.

   The three phantom commands appear often but note that LaTeX provides
a suite of other commands to work with box sizes that may be more
convenient, including ‘\makebox’ (*note \mbox & \makebox::) as well as
‘\settodepth’ (*note \settodepth::), ‘\settoheight’ (*note
\settoheight::), and ‘\settowidth’ (*note \settowidth::).  In addition,
the ‘mathtools’ package has many commands that offer fine-grained
control over spacing.

   All three commands produce an ordinary box, without any special
mathematics status.  So to do something like attaching a superscript you
should give it such a status, for example with the ‘\operatorname’
command from the package ‘amsmath’.

   While most often used in mathematics, these three can appear in other
contexts.  However, they don't cause LaTeX to change into horizontal
mode.  So if one of these starts a paragraph then you should prefix it
with ‘\leavevmode’.

16.6.3 ‘\mathstrut’
-------------------

Synopsis:

     \mathstrut

   The analogue of ‘\strut’ for mathematics.  *Note \strut::.

   The input ‘$\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x^i}$’ gives output where the second
radical is taller than the first.  To add extra vertical space without
any horizontal space, so that the two have the same height, use
‘$\sqrt{x\mathstrut} + \sqrt{x^i\mathstrut}$’.

   The ‘\mathstrut’ command adds the vertical height of an open
parenthesis, ‘(’, but no horizontal space.  It is defined as
‘\vphantom{(}’, so see *note \phantom & \vphantom & \hphantom:: for
more.  An advantage over ‘\strut’ is that ‘\mathstrut’ adds no depth,
which is often the right thing for formulas.  Using the height of an
open parenthesis is just a convention; for complete control over the
amount of space, use ‘\rule’ with a width of zero.  *Note \rule::.

16.7 Math styles
================

TeX's rules for typesetting a formula depend on the context.  For
example, inside a displayed equation, the input ‘\sum_{0\leq
i<n}k^m=\frac{n^{m+1}}{m+1}+\mbox{lower order terms}’ will give output
with the summation index centered below the summation symbol.  But if
that input is inline then the summation index is off to the right rather
than below, so it won't push the lines apart.  Similarly, in a displayed
context, the symbols in the numerator and denominator will be larger
than for an inline context, and in display math subscripts and
superscripts are further apart then they are in inline math.

   TeX uses four math styles.

   • Display style is for a formula displayed on a line by itself, such
     as with ‘\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}’.

   • Text style is for an inline formula, as with ‘so we have $ ... $’.

   • Script style is for parts of a formula in a subscript or
     superscript.

   • Scriptscript style is for parts of a formula at a second level (or
     more) of subscript or superscript.

   TeX determines a default math style but you can override it with a
declaration of ‘\displaystyle’, or ‘\textstyle’, or ‘\scriptstyle’, or
‘\scriptscriptstyle’.

   In this example, the ‘Arithmetic’ line's fraction will look
scrunched.

     \begin{tabular}{r|cc}
       \textsc{Name}  &\textsc{Series}  &\textsc{Sum}  \\  \hline
       Arithmetic     &$a+(a+b)+(a+2b)+\cdots+(a+(n-1)b)$
                        &$na+(n-1)n\cdot\frac{b}{2}$  \\
       Geometric      &$a+ab+ab^2+\cdots+ab^{n-1}$
                        &$\displaystyle a\cdot\frac{1-b^n}{1-b}$  \\
     \end{tabular}

But because of the ‘\displaystyle’ declaration, the ‘Geometric’ line's
fraction will be easy to read, with characters the same size as in the
rest of the line.

   Another example is that, compared to the same input without the
declaration, the result of

     we get
     $\pi=2\cdot{\displaystyle\int_{x=0}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx}$

will have an integral sign that is much taller.  Note that here the
‘\displaystyle’ applies to only part of the formula, and it is delimited
by being inside curly braces, as ‘{\displaystyle ...}’.

   The last example is a continued fraction.

     \begin{equation}
     a_0+\frac{1}{
            \displaystyle a_1+\frac{\mathstrut 1}{
            \displaystyle a_2+\frac{\mathstrut 1}{
            \displaystyle a_3}}}
     \end{equation}

Without the ‘\displaystyle’ declarations, the denominators would be set
in script style and scriptscript style.  (The ‘\mathstrut’ improves the
height of the denominators; *note \mathstrut::.)

     \colon

   In mathematics, the colon character, ‘:’, is a relation.

     With side ratios \( 3:4 \) and \( 4:5 \), the triangle is right.

Ordinary LaTeX defines ‘\colon’ to produce the colon character with the
spacing appropriate for punctuation, as in set-builder notation
‘\{x\colon 0\leq x<1\}’.

   But the widely-used ‘amsmath’ package defines ‘\colon’ for use in the
definition of functions ‘f\colon D\to C’.  So if you want the colon
character as a punctuation then use ‘\mathpunct{:}’.

   In ‘\( A_1\* A_2\* A_3\* A_4 \)’, if there is no line break then
LaTeX outputs it as though it were ‘\( A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 \)’.  If a line
break does happen, for example between the two middle ones, then LaTeX
sets it like ‘\( A_1 A_2 \times \)’, followed by the break, followed by
‘\( A_3 A_4 \)’.

as ‘\sqrt[3]{x+y}’.  The size of the radical grows with that of ARG (as
the height of the radical grows, the angle on the leftmost part gets
steeper, until for a tall enough ‘arg’, it is vertical).

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Modes,  Next: Page styles,  Prev: Math formulas,  Up: Top

17 Modes
********

As LaTeX processes your document, at any point it is in one of six
modes.  They fall into three categories of two each, the horizontal
modes, the math modes, and the vertical modes.  Some commands only work
in one mode or another (in particular, many commands only work in one of
the math modes), and error messages will refer to these.

   • “Paragraph mode” (in plain TeX this is called “horizontal mode”) is
     what LaTeX is in when processing ordinary text.  It breaks the
     input text into lines and finds the positions of line breaks, so
     that in vertical mode page breaks can be done.  This is the mode
     LaTeX is in most of the time.

     “LR mode” (for left-to-right mode; in plain TeX this is called
     “restricted horizontal mode”) is in effect when LaTeX starts making
     a box with an ‘\mbox’ command.  As in paragraph mode, LaTeX's
     output is a string of words with spaces between them.  Unlike in
     paragraph mode, in LR mode LaTeX never starts a new line, it just
     keeps going from left to right.  (Although LaTeX will not complain
     that the LR box is too long, when it is finished and next tries to
     put that box into a line, it might well complain that the finished
     LR box won't fit there.)

   • “Math mode” is when LaTeX is generating an inline mathematical
     formula.

     “Display math mode” is when LaTeX is generating a displayed
     mathematical formula.  (Displayed formulas differ somewhat from
     inline ones.  One example is that the placement of the subscript on
     ‘\int’ differs in the two situations.)

   • “Vertical mode” is when LaTeX is building the list of lines and
     other material making the output page, which comprises insertion of
     page breaks.  This is the mode LaTeX is in when it starts a
     document.

     “Internal vertical mode” is in effect when LaTeX starts making a
     ‘\vbox’.  It has not such thing as page breaks, and as such is the
     vertical analogue of LR mode.

For instance, if you begin a LaTeX article with ‘Let \( x \) be ...’
then these are the modes: first LaTeX starts every document in vertical
mode, then it reads the ‘L’ and switches to paragraph mode, then the
next switch happens at the ‘\(’ where LaTeX changes to math mode, and
then when it leaves the formula it pops back to paragraph mode.

   Paragraph mode has two subcases.  If you use a ‘\parbox’ command or a
‘minipage’ then LaTeX is put into paragraph mode.  But it will not put a
page break here.  Inside one of these boxes, called a “parbox”, LaTeX is
in “inner paragraph mode”.  Its more usual situation, where it can put
page breaks, is “outer paragraph mode” (*note Page breaking::).

* Menu:

* \ensuremath:: Ensure that math mode is active.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \ensuremath,  Up: Modes

17.1 ‘\ensuremath’
==================

Synopsis:

     \ensuremath{FORMULA}

   Ensure that FORMULA is typeset in math mode.

   For instance, you can redefine commands that ordinarily can be used
only in math mode, so that they can be used both in math and in plain
text.

     \newcommand{\dx}{\ensuremath{dx}}
     In $\int f(x)\, \dx$, the \dx{} is an infinitesimal.

   Caution: the ‘\ensuremath’ command is useful but not a panacea.

     \newcommand{\alf}{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
     You get an alpha in text mode: \alf.
     But compare the correct spacing in $\alf+\alf$ with that in \alf+\alf.

Best is to typeset math things in a math mode.

18 Page styles
**************

The style of a page determines where LaTeX places the components of that
page, such as headers and footers, and the text body.  This includes
pages in the main part of the document but also includes special pages
such as the title page of a book, a page from an index, or the first
page of an article.

   The package ‘fancyhdr’ is commonly used for constructing page styles.
See its documentation.

* Menu:

* \maketitle::          Generate a title page.
* \pagenumbering::      Set the style used for page numbers.

18.1 ‘\maketitle’
=================

Synopsis:

     \maketitle

   Generate a title.  In the standard classes the title appears on a
separate page, except in the ‘article’ class where it is at the top of
the first page.  (*Note Document class options::, for information about
the ‘titlepage’ document class option.)

   This example shows ‘\maketitle’ appearing in its usual place,
immediately after ‘\begin{document}’.

     \documentclass{article}
     \title{Constructing a Nuclear Reactor Using Only Coconuts}
     \author{Jonas Grumby\thanks{%
         With the support of a Ginger Grant from the Roy Hinkley Society.} \\
       Skipper, \textit{Minnow}
       \and
       Willy Gilligan\thanks{%
         Thanks to the Mary Ann Summers foundation
         and to Thurston and Lovey Howell.}           \\

     a mighty sailin' man, the Skipper brave and sure. Five passengers set
     sail that day for a three hour tour. A three hour tour.
       ...

   You tell LaTeX the information used to produce the title by making
the following declarations.  These must come before the ‘\maketitle’,
either in the preamble or in the document body.

‘\author{NAME1 \and NAME2 \and ...}’
     Required.  Declare the document author or authors.  The argument is
     a list of authors separated by ‘\and’ commands.  To separate lines
     within a single author's entry, for instance to give the author's
     institution or address, use a double backslash, ‘\\’.  If you omit
     the ‘\author’ declaration then you get ‘LaTeX Warning: No \author
     given’.

‘\date{TEXT}’
     Optional.  Declare TEXT to be the document's date.  The TEXT
     doesn't need to be in a date format; it can be any text at all.  If
     you omit ‘\date’ then LaTeX uses the current date (*note \today::).
     To have no date, instead use ‘\date{}’.

‘\thanks{TEXT}’
     Optional.  Produce a footnote.  You can use it in the author
     information for acknowledgements as illustrated above, but you can
     also use it in the title, or anywhere that a footnote mark makes
     sense.  It can be any text at all so you can use it for any
     purpose, such as to print an email address.

‘\title{TEXT}’
     Required.  Declare TEXT to be the title of the document.  Get line
     breaks inside TEXT with a double backslash, ‘\\’.  If you omit the
     ‘\title’ declaration then the ‘\maketitle’ command yields error
     ‘LaTeX Error: No \title given’.

   To make your own title page, *note titlepage::.  You can either
create this as a one-off or you can include it as part of a renewed
‘\maketitle’ command.  Many publishers will provide a class to use in
place of ‘article’ that formats the title according to their house
requirements.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \pagenumbering,  Next: \pagestyle,  Prev: \maketitle,  Up: Page styles

18.2 ‘\pagenumbering’
=====================

Synopsis:

     \pagenumbering{NUMBER-STYLE}

   Specifies the style of page numbers, and resets the page number.  The
numbering style is reflected on the page, and also in the table of
contents and other page references.  This declaration has global scope
so its effect is not stopped by an end of group such as a closing brace
or an end of environment.

   By default, LaTeX numbers pages starting at 1, using Arabic numerals.

   The argument NUMBER-STYLE is one of the following (see also *note
\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol::).

‘arabic’
     Arabic numerals: 1, 2, ...

‘roman’
     lowercase Roman numerals: i, ii, ...

‘Roman’
     uppercase Roman numerals: I, II, ...

‘alph’
     lowercase letters: a, b, ... If you have more than 26 pages then
     you get ‘LaTeX Error: Counter too large’.

‘Alph’
     uppercase letters: A, B, ... If you have more than 26 pages then
     you get ‘LaTeX Error: Counter too large’.

‘gobble’
     no page number is output, though the number is still reset.
     References to that page also are blank.

     This setting does not work with the popular package ‘hyperref’, so
     to omit page numbers you may want to instead use
     ‘\pagestyle{empty}’ or ‘\thispagestyle{empty}’.

   If you want to typeset the page number in some other way, or change
where the page number appears on the page, see *note \pagestyle:: (in
short: use the ‘fancyhdr’ package).  The list above of LaTeX's built-in
numbering styles cannot be extended.

   Traditionally, if a document has front matter--preface, table of
contents, etc.--then it is numbered with lowercase Roman numerals.  The
main matter of a document uses arabic.  LaTeX implements this, by
providing explicit commands for the different parts (*note \frontmatter
& \mainmatter & \backmatter::).

   As an explicit example, before the ‘Main’ section the pages are
numbered ‘a’, etc.  Starting on the page containing the ‘\pagenumbering’
call in that section, the pages are numbered ‘1’, etc.

     \begin{document}\pagenumbering{alph}
       ...
     \section{Main}\pagenumbering{arabic}
       ...

   If you want to change the value of the page number, then you
manipulate the ‘page’ counter (*note Counters::).

18.3 ‘\pagestyle’
=================

Synopsis:

     \pagestyle{STYLE}

   Declaration that specifies how the page headers and footers are
typeset, from the current page onwards.

   A discussion with an example is below.  First, however: the package
‘fancyhdr’ is now the standard way to manipulate headers and footers.
New documents that need to do anything other than one of the standard
options below should use this package.  See its documentation
(<https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr>).

   Values for STYLE:

‘plain’
     The header is empty.  The footer contains only a page number,
     centered.

‘empty’
     The header and footer are both empty.

‘headings’
     Put running headers and footers on each page.  The document style
     specifies what goes in there; see the discussion below.

‘myheadings’
     Custom headers, specified via the ‘\markboth’ or the ‘\markright’
     commands.

   Some discussion of the motivation for LaTeX's mechanism will help you
work with the options ‘headings’ or ‘myheadings’.  The document source
below produces an article, two-sided, with the pagestyle ‘headings’.  On
this document's left hand pages, LaTeX wants (in addition to the page
number) the title of the current section.  On its right hand pages LaTeX
wants the title of the current subsection.  When it makes up a page,
LaTeX gets this information from the commands ‘\leftmark’ and
‘\rightmark’.  So it is up to ‘\section’ and ‘\subsection’ to store that
information there.

     \documentclass[twoside]{article}
     \pagestyle{headings}
     \begin{document}
       ... \section{Section 1} ... \subsection{Subsection 1.1} ...
     \section{Section 2}
       ...
     \subsection{Subsection 2.1}
       ...
     \subsection{Subsection 2.2}
       ...

Suppose that the second section falls on a left page.  Although when the
page starts it is in the first section, LaTeX will put ‘Section 2’ in
the left page header.  As to the right header, if no subsection starts
before the end of the right page then LaTeX blanks the right hand
header.  If a subsection does appear before the right page finishes then
there are two cases.  If at least one subsection starts on the right
hand page then LaTeX will put in the right header the title of the first
subsection starting on that right page.  If at least one of 2.1, 2.2,
..., starts on the left page but none starts on the right then LaTeX
puts in the right hand header the title of the last subsection to start,
that is, the one in effect during the right hand page.

   To accomplish this, in a two-sided article, LaTeX has ‘\section’
issue a command ‘\markboth’, setting ‘\leftmark’ to ‘Section 2’ and
setting ‘\rightmark’ to an empty content.  And, LaTeX has ‘\subsection’
issue a command ‘\markright’, setting ‘\rightmark’ to ‘Subsection 2.1’,
etc.

   Here are the descriptions of ‘\markboth’ and ‘\markright’:

‘\markboth{LEFT-HEAD}{RIGHT-HEAD}’
     Sets both the right hand and left hand heading information for
     either a page style of ‘headings’ or ‘myheadings’.  A left hand
     page heading LEFT-HEAD is generated by the last ‘\markboth’ command
     before the end of the page.  A right hand page heading RIGHT-HEAD
     is generated by the first ‘\markboth’ or ‘\markright’ that comes on
     the page if there is one, otherwise by the last one that came
     before that page.

‘\markright{RIGHT-HEAD}’
     Sets the right hand page heading, leaving the left unchanged.

18.4 ‘\thispagestyle’
=====================

Synopsis:

     \thispagestyle{STYLE}

   Works in the same way as the ‘\pagestyle’ (*note \pagestyle::),
except that it changes to STYLE for the current page only.  This
declaration has global scope, so its effect is not delimited by braces
or environments.

   Often the first page of a chapter or section has a different style.
For example, this LaTeX book document has the first page of the first
chapter in ‘plain’ style, as is the default (*note Page styles::).

     \documentclass{book}
     \pagestyle{headings}
     \begin{document}
     \chapter{First chapter}
       ...
     \chapter{Second chapter}\thispagestyle{empty}
       ...

The ‘plain’ style has a page number on it, centered in the footer.  To
make the page entirely empty, the command ‘\thispagestyle{empty}’
immediately follows the second ‘\chapter’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \thepage,  Prev: \thispagestyle,  Up: Page styles

18.5 ‘\thepage’
===============

If you want to change the appearance of page numbers only in the page
headers, for example by adding an ornament, typesetting in small caps,
etc., then the ‘fancyhdr’ package, as mentioned in a previous section,
is the best approach.

   On the other hand, you may want to change how page numbers are
denoted everywhere, including the table of contents and
cross-references, as well as the page headers.  In this case, you should
redefine ‘\thepage’, which is the command LaTeX uses for the
representation of page numbers.

   However, ‘\thepage’ should do any typesetting or other complicated
maneuvers, but merely expand to the intended page number representation.
The results of a complicated redefinition of ‘\thepage’ are not
predictable, but LaTeX's report of page numbers in diagnostic messages,
at least, will become unusable.

   There is some discussion of this issue at

19.1 ‘\enspace’ & ‘\quad’ & ‘\qquad’
====================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \enspace
     \quad
     \qquad

   Insert a horizontal space of 1/2em, 1em, or 2em.  The em is a length
defined by a font designer, often thought of as being the width of a
capital M. One advantage of describing space in ems is that it can be
more portable across documents than an absolute measurement such as
points (*note Lengths/em::).

   This puts a suitable gap between two graphics.

     \begin{center}
       \includegraphics{womensmile.png}%
       \qquad\includegraphics{mensmile.png}
     \end{center}

*Note Spacing in math mode::, for ‘\quad’ and ‘\qquad’.  These are
lengths from centuries of typesetting and so may be a better choice in
many circumstances than arbitrary lengths, such as you get with
‘\hspace’.

19.2 ‘\hspace’
==============

Synopsis, one of:

     \hspace{LENGTH}
     \hspace*{LENGTH}

   Insert the amount LENGTH of horizontal space.  The LENGTH can be
positive, negative, or zero; adding a negative amount of space is like
backspacing.  It is a rubber length, that is, it may contain a ‘plus’ or
‘minus’ component, or both (*note Lengths::).  Because the space is
stretchable and shrinkable, it is sometimes called “glue”.

   This makes a line with ‘Name:’ an inch from the right margin.

     \noindent\makebox[\linewidth][r]{Name:\hspace{1in}}

   The ‘*’-form inserts horizontal space that is non-discardable.  More
precisely, when TeX breaks a paragraph into lines any white space--glues
and kerns--that come at a line break are discarded.  The ‘*’-form avoids
that (technically, it adds a non-discardable invisible item in front of
the space).

   In this example

     \parbox{0.8\linewidth}{%
       Fill in each blank: Four \hspace*{1in} and seven years ago our
       fathers brought forth on this continent, a new \hspace*{1in},
       conceived in \hspace*{1in}, and dedicated to the proposition
       that all men are created \hspace*{1in}.}

the 1 inch blank following ‘conceived in’ falls at the start of a line.
If you erase the ‘*’ then LaTeX discards the blank.

   Here, the ‘\hspace’ separates the three graphics.

     \begin{center}
       \includegraphics{lion.png}%   comment keeps out extra space
       \hspace{1cm minus 0.25cm}\includegraphics{tiger.png}%
       \hspace{1cm minus 0.25cm}\includegraphics{bear.png}
     \end{center}

Because the argument to each ‘\hspace’ has ‘minus 0.25cm’, each can
shrink a little if the three figures are too wide.  But each space won't
shrink more than 0.25cm (*note Lengths::).

19.3 ‘\hfill’
=============

Synopsis:

     \hfill

   Produce a rubber length which has no natural space but that can
stretch horizontally as far as needed (*note Lengths::).

   This creates a one-line paragraph with ‘Name:’ on the left side of
the page and ‘Quiz One’ on the right.

     \noindent Name:\hfill Quiz One

   The ‘\hfill’ command is equivalent to ‘\hspace{\fill}’ and so the
space can be discarded at line breaks.  To avoid that instead use
‘\hspace*{\fill}’ (*note \hspace::).

   Here the graphs are evenly spaced in the middle of the figure.

     \newcommand*{\vcenteredhbox}[1]{\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}#1\end{tabular}}
       ...
     \begin{figure}
       \hspace*{\fill}%
       \vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics{graph0.png}}%

       \hspace*{\fill}%
       \caption{Comparison of two graphs} \label{fig:twographs}
     \end{figure}

Note the ‘\hspace*’'s where the space could otherwise be dropped.

19.4 ‘\hss’
===========

Synopsis:

     \hss

   Produce a horizontal space that is infinitely shrinkable as well as
infinitely stretchable (this command is a TeX primitive).  LaTeX authors
should reach first for the ‘\makebox’ command to get the effects of
‘\hss’ (*note \mbox & \makebox::).

   Here, the first line's ‘\hss’ makes the Z stick out to the right,
overwriting the Y. In the second line the Z sticks out to the left,
overwriting the X.

     X\hbox to 0pt{Z\hss}Y
     X\hbox to 0pt{\hss Z}Y

Without the ‘\hss’ you get something like ‘Overfull \hbox (6.11111pt too
wide) detected at line 20’.

19.5 ‘\spacefactor’
===================

Synopsis:

     \spacefactor=INTEGER

   Influence LaTeX's stretching and shrinking of glue.  Few user-level
documents need to use this.

   While LaTeX is laying out the material, it may stretch or shrink the
gaps between words.  (This space is not a character; it is called the
“interword glue”; *note \hspace::).  The ‘\spacefactor’ parameter (a TeX
primitive) allows you to, for instance, have the space after a period
stretch more than the space after a word-ending letter.

   After LaTeX places each character, or rule or other box, it sets a
parameter called the “space factor”.  If the next thing in the input is
a space then this parameter affects how much stretching or shrinking can
happen.  A space factor that is larger than the normal value means that
the glue can stretch more and shrink less.  Normally, the space factor
is 1000.  This value is in effect following most characters, and any
non-character box or math formula.  But it is 3000 after a period,
exclamation mark, or question mark, 2000 after a colon, 1500 after a
semicolon, 1250 after a comma, and 0 after a right parenthesis or
bracket, or closing double quote or single quote.  Finally, it is 999
after a capital letter.

   If the space factor F is 1000 then the glue gap will be the font's
normal space value (for Computer Modern Roman 10 point this is
3.3333pt).  Otherwise, if the space factor F is greater than 2000 then
TeX adds the font's extra space value (for Computer Modern Roman 10
point this is 1.11111pt), and then the font's normal stretch value is
multiplied by f /1000 and the normal shrink value is multiplied by
1000/f (for Computer Modern Roman 10 point these are 1.66666 and
1.11111pt).

   For example, consider the period ending ‘A man's best friend is his
dog.’.  After it, TeX puts in a fixed extra space, and also allows the
glue to stretch 3 times as much and shrink 1/3 as much, as the glue
after ‘friend’ or any of the other words, since they are not followed by
punctuation.

   The rules for space factors are even more complex because they play
additional roles.  In practice, there are two consequences.  First, if a
period or other punctuation is followed by a right parenthesis or
bracket, or right single or double quote then the spacing effect of that
period carries through those characters (that is, the following glue
will have increased stretch and shrink).  Second, if punctuation comes
after a capital letter then the normal effect of the period is does not
happen, so you get an ordinary space.  This second case also affects
abbreviations that do not end in a capital letter (*note \@::).

   You can only use ‘\spacefactor’ in paragraph mode or LR mode (*note
Modes::).  You can see the current value with ‘\the\spacefactor’ or
‘\showthe\spacefactor’.

   Finally, not especially related to ‘\spacefactor’ itself: if you get
errors like ‘You can't use `\spacefactor' in vertical mode’, or ‘You
can't use `\spacefactor' in math mode.’, or ‘Improper \spacefactor’ then
you have probably tried to redefine an internal command.  *Note
\makeatletter & \makeatother::.

* Menu:

* \@::              Distinguish sentence-ending periods from abbreviations.
* \frenchspacing & \nonfrenchspacing::   Equal interword and inter-sentence space.
* \normalsfcodes::   Restore space factor settings to the default.

19.5.1 ‘\@’
-----------

Synopsis:

     CAPITAL-LETTER\@.

   Treat a period (or other punctuation) as sentence-ending, where LaTeX
would otherwise think it is part of an abbreviation.  LaTeX thinks that
a period ends an abbreviation if the period comes after a capital
letter, and otherwise thinks the period ends the sentence.

   This example shows the two cases to remember.

     The songs \textit{Red Guitar}, etc.\ are by Loudon Wainwright~III\@.

The first period ends the abbreviation ‘etc.’ but not the sentence.  The
backslash-space, ‘\ ’, produces a mid-sentence space.  The second period
ends the sentence, despite it being preceded by a capital letter.  We
tell LaTeX that it ends the sentence by putting ‘\@’ before it.

   So: if you have a capital letter followed by a period that ends the
sentence, then put ‘\@’ before the period.  This holds even if there is
an intervening right parenthesis or bracket, or right single or double
quote, because the spacing effect of that period carries through those
characters.  For example, this

     Use the \textit{Instructional Practices Guide},
     (a book by the MAA)\@.

will have correct inter-sentence spacing after the period.

   The ‘\@’ command is only for text modes.  If you use it outside of a
text mode then you get the error ‘You can't use `\spacefactor' in
vertical mode’ (*note Modes::).

   All the above applies equally to question marks and exclamation
points as periods, since all are sentence-ending punctuation, and LaTeX
increases the space after each in the same way, when they end a
sentence.  LaTeX also increases spacing after colon, semicolon, and
comma characters (*note \spacefactor::).

   In addition: the converse case is a period (or other punctuation)
that does not end a sentence.  For that case, follow the period with a
backslash-space, (‘\ ’), or a tie, (‘~’), or ‘\@’.  Examples are ‘Nat.\
Acad.\ Science’, and ‘Mr.~Bean’, and ‘(manure, etc.\@) for sale’ (note
in the last one that the ‘\@’ comes after the period but before the
closing parenthesis).

19.5.2 ‘\frenchspacing’ & ‘\nonfrenchspacing’
---------------------------------------------

Synopsis, one of:

     \frenchspacing
     \nonfrenchspacing

   ‘\frenchspacing’ causes LaTeX to make spacing after all punctuation,
including periods, be the same as the space between words in the middle
of a sentence.  ‘\nonfrenchspacing’ switches back to the default
handling in which spacing after most punctuation stretches or shrinks
differently than a word space (*note \spacefactor::).

   In American English, the typesetting tradition is to adjust,
typically increasing, the space after punctuation more than the space
between words that are in the middle of a sentence.  Declaring
‘\frenchspacing’ (the command is inherited from plain TeX) switches to
the tradition that all spaces are treated equally.

   If your LaTeX document specifies the language being used, for example
with the ‘babel’ package, the necessary settings should be taken care of
for you.

19.6 Backslash-space, ‘\ ’
==========================

This section refers to the command consisting of two characters, a
backslash followed by a space.  Synopsis:

     \

   Produce a space.  By default it produces white space of length
3.33333pt plus 1.66666pt minus 1.11111pt.

   When you type one or more blanks between words, LaTeX produces
whitespace that is different than an explicit space.  This illustrates:

     \begin{tabular}{rl}
     One blank:& makes some space \\
     Three blanks:&   in a row \\
     Three spaces:&\ \ \ in a row \\
     \end{tabular}

On the first line LaTeX puts some space after the colon.  On the second
line LaTeX collapses the three blanks to output one whitespace, so you
end with the same space after the colon as in the first line.  LaTeX
would similarly collapse them to a single whitespace if one, two or all
of the three blanks were replaced by a tab, or by a newline.  However,
the bottom line asks for three spaces so the white area is wider.  That
is, the backslash-space command creates a fixed amount of horizontal
space.  (Note that you can define a horizontal space of any width at all
with ‘\hspace’; see *note \hspace::.)

   The backslash-space command has two main uses.  It is often used
after control sequences to keep them from gobbling the blank that
follows, as after ‘\TeX’ in ‘\TeX\ (or \LaTeX)’.  (But using curly
braces has the advantage of still working whether the next character is
a blank or any other non-letter, as in ‘\TeX{} (or \LaTeX{})’ in which
‘{}’ can be added after ‘\LaTeX’ as well as after ‘\TeX’.)  The other
common use is that it marks a period as ending an abbreviation instead
of ending a sentence, as in ‘Prof.\ Smith’ or ‘Jones et al.\ (1993)’
(*note \@::).

   Under normal circumstances, ‘\’<TAB> and ‘\’<NEWLINE> are equivalent
to backslash-space, ‘\ ’.

   In order to allow source code indentation, under normal
circumstances, TeX ignores leading blanks in a line.  So the following
prints ‘one word’:

     one
      word

where the white space between ‘one’ and ‘word’ is produced by the
newline after ‘one’, not by the space before ‘word’.

19.7 ‘~’, ‘\nobreakspace’
=========================

Synopsis:

     BEFORE~AFTER

   The “tie” character, ‘~’, produces a space between BEFORE and AFTER
at which the line will not be broken.  By default the white space has
length 3.33333pt plus 1.66666pt minus 1.11111pt (*note Lengths::).  The
command ‘\nobreakspace’ and the Unicode input character U+00A0 (also in
many 8-bit encodings) are synonyms.

   Note that the word ‘tie’ has this meaning in the TeX/Texinfo
community; this differs from the typographic term "tie", which is a
diacritic in the shape of an arc, called a "tie-after" accent in ‘The
TeXbook’.

   Here LaTeX will not break the line between the final two words:

     Thanks to Prof.~Lerman.

In addition, despite the period, LaTeX does not use the end-of-sentence
spacing (*note \@::).

   Ties prevent a line break where that could cause confusion.  They
also still allow hyphenation (of either of the tied words), so they are
generally preferable to putting consecutive words in an ‘\mbox’ (*note
\mbox & \makebox::).

   Exactly where ties should be used is something of a matter of taste,
sometimes alarmingly dogmatic taste, among readers.  Nevertheless, here
are some usage models, many of them from ‘The TeXbook’.

   • Between an enumerator label and number, such as in references:
     ‘Chapter~12’, or ‘Theorem~\ref{th:Wilsons}’, or
     ‘Figure~\ref{fig:KGraph}’.

   • When cases are enumerated inline: ‘(b)~Show that $f(x)$ is
     (1)~continuous, and (2)~bounded’.

   • Between a number and its unit: ‘$745.7.8$~watts’ (the ‘siunitx’
     package has a special facility for this) or ‘144~eggs’.  This
     includes between a month and day number in a date: ‘October~12’ or
     ‘12~Oct’.  In general, in any expressions where numbers and
     abbreviations or symbols are separated by a space: ‘AD~565’, or
     ‘2:50~pm’, or ‘Boeing~747’, or ‘268~Plains Road’, or
     ‘\$$1.4$~billion’.  Other common choices here are a thin space
     (*note \thinspace & \negthinspace::) and no space at all.

   • When mathematical phrases are rendered in words: ‘equals~$n$’, or
     ‘less than~$\epsilon$’, or ‘given~$X$’, or ‘modulo~$p^e$ for all
     large~$n$’ (but compare ‘is~$15$’ with ‘is $15$~times the height’).
     Between mathematical symbols in apposition with nouns:
     ‘dimension~$d$’ or ‘function~$f(x)$’ (but compare ‘with length
     $l$~or more’).  When a symbol is a tightly bound object of a
     preposition: ‘of~$x$’, or ‘from $0$ to~$1$’, or ‘in common
     with~$m$’.

   • Between symbols in series: ‘$1$,~$2$, or~$3$’ or ‘$1$,~$2$,
     \ldots,~$n$’.

   • Between a person's given names and between multiple surnames:
     ‘Donald~E. Knuth’, or ‘Luis~I. Trabb~Pardo’, or ‘Charles~XII’--but
     you must give TeX places to break the line so you might do ‘Charles
     Louis Xavier~Joseph de~la Vall\'ee~Poussin’.

19.8 ‘\thinspace’ & ‘\negthinspace’
===================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \thinspace
     \negthinspace

   These produce unbreakable and unstretchable spaces of 1/6em and
-1/6em, respectively.  These are the text mode equivalents of ‘\,’ and
‘\!’ (*note Spacing in math mode/\thinspace::).

   You can use ‘\,’ as a synonym for ‘\thinspace’ in text mode.

   One common use of ‘\thinspace’ is as the space between nested quotes:

     Killick replied, ``I heard the Captain say, `Ahoy there.'\thinspace''

Another use is that some style guides call for a ‘\thinspace’ between an
ellipsis and a sentence ending period (other style guides, think the
three dots and/or four dots are plenty).  Another style-specific use is
between initials, as in ‘D.\thinspace E.\ Knuth’.

   LaTeX provides a variety of similar spacing commands for math mode
(*note Spacing in math mode::).  With the ‘amsmath’ package, or as of
the 2020-10-01 LaTeX release, they can be used in text mode as well as
math mode, including ‘\!’ for ‘\negthinspace’; but otherwise, they are
available only in math mode.

19.9 ‘\/’
=========

Synopsis:

     BEFORE-CHARACTER\/AFTER-CHARACTER

   Insert an “italic correction”, a small space defined by the font
designer for each character (possibly zero), to avoid the character
colliding with whatever follows.  When you use ‘\/’, LaTeX takes the
correction from the font metric file, scales it by any scaling that has
been applied to the font, and then inserts that much horizontal space.

   Here, were it not for the ‘\/’, the BEFORE-CHARACTER italic f would
hit the AFTER-CHARACTER roman H

     \newcommand{\companylogo}{{\it f}\/H}

because the italic letter f leans far to the right.

   If AFTER-CHARACTER is a period or comma then don't insert an italic
correction since those punctuation symbols are so low to the baseline
already.  However, with semicolons or colons, as well as with normal
letters, the italic correction can help.  It is typically used between a
switch from italic or slanted fonts to an upright font.

   When you use commands such as ‘\emph’ and ‘\textit’ and ‘\textsl’ to
change fonts, LaTeX automatically inserts the italic correction when
needed (*note Font styles::).  However, declarations such as ‘\em’ and
‘\itshape’ and ‘\slshape’ do not automatically insert italic
corrections.

   Upright characters can also have an italic correction.  An example
where this is needed is the name ‘pdf\/\TeX’.  However, most upright
characters have a zero italic correction.  Some font creators do not
include italic correction values even for italic fonts.

   Technically, LaTeX uses another font-specific value, the so-called
“slant parameter” (namely ‘\fontdimen1’), to determine whether to
possibly insert an italic correction, rather than tying the action to
particular font commands.

   There is no concept of italic correction in math mode; math spacing
is done in a different way.

19.10 ‘\hrulefill’ & ‘\dotfill’
===============================

Synopsis, one of:

     \hrulefill
     \dotfill

   Produce an infinite horizontal rubber length (*note Lengths::) that
LaTeX fills with a rule (that is, a line) or with dots, instead of white
space.

   This outputs a line 2 inches long.

     Name:~\makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}

This example, when placed between blank lines, creates a paragraph that
is left and right justified and where the middle is filled with evenly
spaced dots.

     \noindent John Aubrey, RN \dotfill{} Melbury Lodge

   To make the rule or dots go to the line's end use ‘\null’ at the
start or end.

   To change the rule's thickness, copy the definition and adjust it, as
here

     \renewcommand{\hrulefill}{%
       \leavevmode\leaders\hrule height 1pt\hfill\kern0pt }

which changes the default thickness of 0.4pt to 1pt.  Similarly, adjust
the dot spacing as with

     \renewcommand{\dotfill}{%
       \leavevmode\cleaders\hbox to 1.00em{\hss .\hss }\hfill\kern0pt }

which changes the default length of 0.33em to 1.00em.

   This example produces a line for a signature.

     \begin{minipage}{4cm}
       \centering
       \hrulefill\\

============================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \bigskip
     \medskip
     \smallskip

   Produce an amount of vertical space, large or medium-sized or small.
These commands are fragile (*note \protect::).

   Here the skip suggests the passage of time (from The Golden Ocean by
O'Brian).

     Mr Saumarez would have something rude to say to him, no doubt: he
     was at home again, and it was delightful.

     \bigskip
     ``A hundred and fifty-seven miles and one third, in twenty-four hours,''
     said Peter.

   Each command is associated with a length defined in the document
class file.

‘\bigskip’
     The same as ‘\vspace{\bigskipamount}’, ordinarily about one line
     space, with stretch and shrink.  The default for the ‘book’ and
     ‘article’ classes is ‘12pt plus 4pt minus 4pt’.

‘\medskip’
     The same as ‘\vspace{\medskipamount}’, ordinarily about half of a
     line space, with stretch and shrink.  The default for the ‘book’
     and ‘article’ classes is ‘6pt plus 2pt minus 2pt’.

‘\smallskip’
     The same as ‘\vspace{\smallskipamount}’, ordinarily about a quarter
     of a line space, with stretch and shrink.  The default for the
     ‘book’ and ‘article’ classes is ‘3pt plus 1pt minus 1pt’.

   Because each command is a ‘\vspace’, if you use it in mid-paragraph
then it will insert its vertical space between the line in which you use
it and the next line, not necessarily at the place that you use it.  So
these are best between paragraphs.

   The commands ‘\bigbreak’, ‘\medbreak’, and ‘\smallbreak’ are similar
but also suggest to LaTeX that this is a good place to put a page break
(*note \bigbreak & \medbreak & \smallbreak::.

produce the same vertical space but differ in that they also remove a
preceding vertical space if it is less than what they would insert (as
with ‘\addvspace’).  In addition, they terminate a paragraph where they
are used: this example

     abc\bigbreak def ghi

     jkl mno pqr

will output three paragraphs, the first ending in ‘abc’ and the second
starting, after an extra vertical space and a paragraph indent, with
‘def’.

19.13 ‘\strut’
==============

Synopsis:

     \strut

   Ensure that the current line has height at least ‘0.7\baselineskip’
and depth at least ‘0.3\baselineskip’.  Essentially, LaTeX inserts into
the line a rectangle having zero width,
‘\rule[-0.3\baselineskip]{0pt}{\baselineskip}’ (*note \rule::).  The
‘\baselineskip’ changes with the current font or fontsize.

   In this example the ‘\strut’ keeps the box inside the frame from
having zero height.

     \setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}\framebox[2in]{\strut}

   This example has four lists.  In the first there is a much bigger gap
between items 2 and 3 than there is between items 1 and 2.  The second
list fixes that with a ‘\strut’ at the end of its first item's second
line.

     \setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}
     \noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{0.2\linewidth}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item \parbox[t]{15pt}{test \\ test}
       \item test
       \item test
     \end{enumerate}
     \end{minipage}%
     \begin{minipage}[t]{0.2\linewidth}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item \parbox[t]{15pt}{test \\ test\strut}
       \item test
       \item test
     \end{enumerate}
     \end{minipage}%
     \begin{minipage}[t]{0.2\linewidth}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item \fbox{\parbox[t]{15pt}{test \\ test}}
       \item \fbox{test}
       \item \fbox{test}
     \end{enumerate}
     \end{minipage}%
     \begin{minipage}[t]{0.2\linewidth}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item \fbox{\parbox[t]{15pt}{test \\ test\strut}}
       \item \fbox{test}
       \item \fbox{test}
     \end{enumerate}
     \end{minipage}%

The final two lists use ‘\fbox’ to show what's happening.  The first
item ‘\parbox’ of the third list goes only to the bottom of its second
‘test’, which happens not have any characters that descend below the
baseline.  The fourth list adds the strut that gives the needed extra
below-baseline space.

   The ‘\strut’ command is often useful in graphics, such as in ‘TikZ’
or ‘Asymptote’.  For instance, you may have a command such as
‘\graphnode{NODE-NAME}’ that fits a circle around NODE-NAME.  However,
unless you are careful the NODE-NAME's ‘x’ and ‘y’ will produce
different-diameter circles because the characters are different sizes.
A careful ‘\graphnode’ might insert a ‘\strut’, then NODE-NAME, and then
draw the circle.

   The general approach of using a zero width ‘\rule’ is useful in many
circumstances.  In this table, the zero-width rule keeps the top of the
first integral from hitting the ‘\hline’.  Similarly, the second rule
keeps the second integral from hitting the first.

     \begin{tabular}{rl}
       \textsc{Integral}   &\textsc{Value}           \\
       \hline
       $\int_0^x t\, dt$   &$x^2/2$  \rule{0em}{2.5ex} \\
       $\int_0^x t^2\, dt$ &$x^3/3$  \rule{0em}{2.5ex}
     \end{tabular}

(Although the line-ending double backslash command has an available
optional argument to change the corresponding baseline skip, that won't
solve this issue.  Changing the first double backslash to something like
‘\\[2.5ex]’ will put more room between the header line and the ‘\hline’
rule, and the integral would still hit the rule.)

19.14 ‘\vspace’
===============

Synopsis, one of:

     \vspace{LENGTH}
     \vspace*{LENGTH}

   Add the vertical space LENGTH.  The LENGTH can be positive, negative,
or zero.  It is a rubber length--it may contain a ‘plus’ or ‘minus’
component (*note Lengths::).

   This puts space between the two paragraphs.

     And I slept.

     \vspace{1ex plus 0.5ex}
     The new day dawned cold.

(*Note \bigskip & \medskip & \smallskip::, for common inter-paragraph
spaces.)

   The ‘*’-form inserts vertical space that is non-discardable.  More
precisely, LaTeX discards vertical space at a page break and the
‘*’-form causes the space to stay.  This example leaves space between
the two questions.

     Question: Find the integral of \( 5x^4+5 \).

     \vspace*{2cm plus 0.5cm}
     Question: Find the derivative of \( x^5+5x+9 \).

That space will be present even if the page break happens to fall
between the questions.

   If you use ‘\vspace’ in the middle of a paragraph (i.e., in
horizontal mode) then the space is inserted after the line containing
the ‘\vspace’ command; it does not start a new paragraph at the
‘\vspace’ command.

   In this example the two questions will be evenly spaced vertically on
the page, with at least one inch of space below each.

     \begin{document}
     1) Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?
     \vspace{1in plus 1fill}

     2) Who put the ram in the rama lama ding dong?
     \vspace{1in plus 1fill}
     \end{document}

19.15 ‘\vfill’
==============

Synopsis:

     \vfill

   End the current paragraph and insert a vertical rubber length that is
infinite, so it can stretch or shrink as far as needed (*note
Lengths::).

   It is often used in the same way as ‘\vspace{\fill}’, except that
‘\vfill’ ends the current paragraph whereas ‘\vspace{\fill}’ adds the
infinite vertical space below its line, irrespective of the paragraph
structure.  In both cases that space will disappear at a page boundary;
to circumvent this see the starred option in *note \vspace::.

   In this example the page is filled, so the top and bottom lines
contain the text ‘Lost Dog!’ and the second ‘Lost Dog!’ is exactly
halfway between them.

     \begin{document}
     Lost Dog!
     \vfill
     Lost Dog!  % perfectly in the middle
     \vfill
     Lost Dog!
     \end{document}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addvspace,  Prev: \vfill,  Up: Spaces

19.16 ‘\addvspace’
==================

Synopsis:

     \addvspace{VERT-LENGTH}

   Add a vertical space of VERT-LENGTH.  However, if there are two or
more ‘\addvspace’'s in a sequence then together they only add the space
needed to make the natural length equal to the maximum of the
VERT-LENGTH's in that sequence.  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).  The VERT-LENGTH is a rubber length (*note Lengths::).

   This example illustrates.  The ‘picture’ draws a scale over which to
rules are placed.  In a standard LaTeX article the length
‘\baselineskip’ is 12pt.  As shown by the scale, the two rules are 22pt
apart: the sum of the ‘\baselineskip’ and the 10pt from the first
‘\addvspace’.

     \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage{color}
     \begin{document}
     \setlength{\unitlength}{2pt}%
     \noindent\begin{picture}(0,0)%
       \multiput(0,0)(0,-1){25}{{\color{blue}\line(1,0){1}}}
       \multiput(0,0)(0,-5){6}{{\color{red}\line(1,0){2}}}
     \end{picture}%
     \rule{0.25\linewidth}{0.1pt}%
     \par\addvspace{10pt}% \addvspace{20pt}%
     \par\noindent\rule{0.25\linewidth}{0.1pt}%
     \end{document}

Now uncomment the second ‘\addvspace’.  It does not make the gap 20pt
longer; instead the gap is the sum of ‘\baselineskip’ and 20pt.  So
‘\addvspace’ in a sense does the opposite of its name--it makes sure
that multiple vertical spaces do not accumulate, but instead that only
the largest one is used.

   LaTeX uses this command to adjust the vertical space above or below
an environment that starts a new paragraph.  For instance, a ‘theorem’
environment begins and ends with ‘\addvspace’ so that two consecutive
‘theorem’'s are separated by one vertical space, not two.

   A error ‘Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item’ pointing to an
‘\addvspace’ means that you were not in vertical mode when you hit this
command.  One way to change that is to precede ‘\addvspace’ with a
‘\par’ command (*note \par::), as in the above example.

20 Boxes
********

At its core, LaTeX puts things in boxes and then puts the boxes on a
page.  So these commands are central.

   There are many packages on CTAN that are useful for manipulating
boxes.  One useful adjunct to the commands here is ‘adjustbox’.

* Menu:

* \mbox & \makebox::    Horizontal boxes.
* \fbox & \framebox::   Put a frame around a box.
* \parbox::             Box with text in paragraph mode.
* \raisebox::           Raise or lower text.
* \sbox & \savebox::    Like ‘\makebox’ but save the text for later.
* lrbox::               Environment version of ‘\sbox’.
* \usebox::             Print saved text.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \mbox & \makebox,  Next: \fbox & \framebox,  Up: Boxes

20.1 ‘\mbox’ & ‘\makebox’
=========================

Synopsis, one of:

     \mbox{TEXT}
     \makebox{TEXT}
     \makebox[WIDTH]{TEXT}
     \makebox[WIDTH][POSITION]{TEXT}

   Create a box, a container for material.  The TEXT is typeset in LR
mode (*note Modes::) so it is not broken into lines.  The ‘\mbox’
command is robust, while ‘\makebox’ is fragile (*note \protect::).

   Because ‘text’ is not broken into lines, you can use ‘\mbox’ to
prevent hyphenation.  In this example, LaTeX will not hyphenate the tank
name, ‘T-34’.

     The soviet tank \mbox{T-34} is a symbol of victory against nazism.

   The first two command invocations shown, ‘\mbox’ and ‘\makebox’, are
roughly the same.  They create a box just wide enough to contain the
TEXT.  (They are like plain TeX's ‘\hbox’.)

   In the third version the optional argument WIDTH specifies the width
of the box.  Note that the space occupied by the text need not equal the
width of the box.  For one thing, TEXT can be too small; this creates a
full-line box:

     \makebox[\linewidth]{Chapter Exam}

with ‘Chapter Exam’ centered.  But TEXT can also be too wide for WIDTH.
See the example below of zero-width boxes.

   In the WIDTH argument you can use the following lengths that refer to
the dimension of the box that LaTeX gets on typesetting TEXT: ‘\depth’,
‘\height’, ‘\width’, ‘\totalheight’ (this is the box's height plus its
depth).  For example, to make a box with the text stretched to double
the natural size you can say this.

     \makebox[2\width]{Get a stretcher}

   For the fourth command synopsis version the optional argument
POSITION gives position of the text within the box.  It may take the
following values:

‘c’
     The TEXT is centered (default).

‘l’
     The TEXT is flush left.

‘r’
     Flush right.

‘s’
     Stretch the interword space in TEXT across the entire WIDTH.  The
     TEXT must contain stretchable space for this to work.  For
     instance, this could head a press release:
     ‘\noindent\makebox[\textwidth][s]{\large\hfil IMMEDIATE\hfil
     RELEASE\hfil}’

   A common use of ‘\makebox’ is to make zero-width text boxes.  This
puts the value of the quiz questions to the left of those questions.

     \newcommand{\pts}[1]{\makebox[0em][r]{#1 points\hspace*{1em}}}
     \pts{10}What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?

     \pts{90}An African or European swallow?

   The right edge of the output ‘10 points ’ (note the ending space
after ‘points’) will be just before the ‘What’.  You can use ‘\makebox’
similarly when making graphics, such as in ‘TikZ’ or ‘Asymptote’, where
you put the edge of the text at a known location, regardless of the
length of that text.

   For boxes with frames see *note \fbox & \framebox::.  For colors
see *note Colored boxes::.

   There is a related version of ‘\makebox’ that is used within the
‘picture’ environment, where the length is given in terms of
‘\unitlength’ (*note \makebox (picture)::).

   As TEXT is typeset in LR mode, neither a double backslash ‘\\’ nor
‘\par’ will give you a new line; for instance ‘\makebox{abc def \\ ghi}’
outputs ‘abc defghi’ while ‘\makebox{abc def \par ghi}’ outputs ‘abc def
ghi’, both on a single line.  To get multiple lines see *note \parbox::
and *note minipage::.

20.2 ‘\fbox’ & ‘\framebox’
==========================

Synopses, one of:

     \fbox{TEXT}
     \framebox{TEXT}
     \framebox[WIDTH]{TEXT}
     \framebox[WIDTH][POSITION]{TEXT}

   Create a box with an enclosing frame, four rules surrounding the
TEXT.  These commands are the same as ‘\mbox’ and ‘\makebox’ except for
the frame (*note \mbox & \makebox::).  The ‘\fbox’ command is robust,
the ‘\framebox’ command is fragile (*note \protect::).

     \fbox{Warning! No work shown, no credit given.}

LaTeX puts the text into a box, the text cannot be hyphenated.  Around
that box, separated from it by a small gap, are four rules making a
frame.

   The first two command invocations, ‘\fbox{...}’ and ‘\framebox{...}’,
are roughly the same.  As to the third and fourth invocations, the
optional arguments allow you to specify the box width as WIDTH and the
position of the text inside that box as POSITION.  *Note \mbox &
\makebox::, for the full description but here is an example creating an
empty box that is 1/4in wide.

     \setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}\framebox[0.25in]{\strut}}

The ‘\strut’ ensures a total height of ‘\baselineskip’ (*note \strut::).

   These parameters determine the frame layout.

‘\fboxrule’
     The thickness of the rules around the enclosed box.  The default is
     0.2pt.  Change it with a command such as
     ‘\setlength{\fboxrule}{0.8pt}’ (*note \setlength::).

‘\fboxsep’
     The distance from the frame to the enclosed box.  The default is
     3pt.  Change it with a command such as ‘\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}’
     (*note \setlength::).  Setting it to 0pt is useful sometimes: this
     will put a frame around the picture with no white border.

          {\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}%
           \framebox{%
             \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{prudence.jpg}}}

     The extra curly braces keep the effect of the ‘\setlength’ local.

   As with ‘\mbox’ and ‘\makebox’, LaTeX will not break lines in TEXT.
But this example has LaTeX break lines to make a paragraph, and then
frame the result.

     \framebox{%
       \begin{minipage}{0.6\linewidth}
         My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place.
         And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.
       \end{minipage}}

   *Note Colored boxes::, for colors other than black and white.

   The ‘picture’ environment has a version of the ‘\framebox’ command
where the units depend on ‘picture’'s ‘\unitlength’ (*note \framebox
(picture)::).

20.3 ‘\parbox’
==============

Synopses, one of:

     \parbox{WIDTH}{CONTENTS}
     \parbox[POSITION]{WIDTH}{CONTENTS}
     \parbox[POSITION][HEIGHT]{WIDTH}{CONTENTS}
     \parbox[POSITION][HEIGHT][INNER-POS]{WIDTH}{CONTENTS}

   Produce a box of text that is WIDTH wide.  Use this command to make a
box of small pieces of text, of a single paragraph.  This command is
fragile (*note \protect::).

     \begin{picture}(0,0)
       ...
       \put(1,2){\parbox{1.75in}{\raggedright Because the graph is a line on
                              this semilog paper, the relationship is
                              exponential.}}
     \end{picture}

   The CONTENTS are processed in a text mode (*note Modes::) so LaTeX
will break lines to make a paragraph.  But it won't make multiple
paragraphs; for that, use a ‘minipage’ environment (*note minipage::).

   The options for ‘\parbox’ (except for CONTENTS) are the same as those
for ‘minipage’.  For convenience a summary of the options is here but
see *note minipage:: for a complete description.

   There are two required arguments.  The WIDTH is a rigid length (*note
Lengths::).  It sets the width of the box into which LaTeX typesets
CONTENTS.  The CONTENTS is the text that is placed in that box.  It
should not have any paragraph-making components.

   There are three optional arguments, POSITION, HEIGHT, and INNER-POS.
The POSITION gives the vertical alignment of the “parbox” with respect
to the surrounding material.  The supported values are ‘c’ or ‘m’ to
make the vertical center of the parbox lines up with the center of the
adjacent text line (this is the default), or ‘t’ to match the top line
of the parbox with the baseline of the surrounding material, or ‘b’ to
match the bottom line.

   The optional argument HEIGHT overrides the natural height of the box.

   The optional argument INNER-POS controls the placement of CONTENT
inside the ‘parbox’.  Its default is the value of POSITION.  Its
possible values are: ‘t’ to put the CONTENT at the top of the box, ‘c’
to put it in the vertical center, ‘b’ to put it at the bottom of the
box, and ‘s’ to stretch it out vertically (for this, the text must
contain vertically stretchable space).

20.4 ‘\raisebox’
================

Synopsis, one of:

     \raisebox{DISTANCE}{TEXT}
     \raisebox{DISTANCE}[HEIGHT]{TEXT}
     \raisebox{DISTANCE}[HEIGHT][DEPTH]{TEXT}

   Raise or lower TEXT.  This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   This example makes a command for denoting the restriction of a
function by lowering the vertical bar symbol.

     \newcommand*\restricted[1]{\raisebox{-.5ex}{$|$}_{#1}}
     $f\restricted{A}$

   The first mandatory argument DISTANCE specifies how far to raise the
second mandatory argument TEXT.  This is a rigid length (*note
Lengths::).  If it is negative then it lowers TEXT.  The TEXT is
processed in LR mode so it cannot contain line breaks (*note Modes::).

   The optional arguments HEIGHT and DEPTH are dimensions.  If they are
specified, they override the natural height and depth of the box LaTeX
gets by typesetting TEXT.

   In the arguments DISTANCE, HEIGHT, and DEPTH you can use the
following lengths that refer to the dimension of the box that LaTeX gets
on typesetting TEXT: ‘\depth’, ‘\height’, ‘\width’, ‘\totalheight’ (this
is the box's height plus its depth).

   This will align two graphics on their top (*note Graphics::).

     \usepackage{graphicx,calc}  % in preamble
        ...
     \begin{center}
       \raisebox{1ex-\height}{%
         \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{lion.png}}
       \qquad
       \raisebox{1ex-\height}{%
         \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{meta.png}}
     \end{center}

The first ‘\height’ is the height of ‘lion.png’ while the second is the
height of ‘meta.png’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \sbox & \savebox,  Next: lrbox,  Prev: \raisebox,  Up: Boxes

20.5 ‘\sbox’ & ‘\savebox’
=========================

Synopsis, one of:

     \sbox{BOX-CMD}{TEXT}
     \savebox{BOX-CMD}{TEXT}
     \savebox{BOX-CMD}[WIDTH]{TEXT}
     \savebox{BOX-CMD}[WIDTH][POS]{TEXT}

   Typeset TEXT just as with ‘\makebox’ (*note \mbox & \makebox::)
except that LaTeX does not output it but instead saves it in a box
register referred to by a variable named BOX-CMD.  The variable name
BOX-CMD begins with a backslash, ‘\’.  You must have previously
allocated the box register BOX-CMD with ‘\newsavebox’ (*note
\newsavebox::).  The ‘\sbox’ command is robust while ‘\savebox’ is
fragile (*note \protect::).

   This creates and uses a box register.

     \newsavebox{\fullname}
     \sbox{\fullname}{John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt}
       ...
     \usebox{\fullname}! His name is my name, too!
     Whenever we go out, the people always shout!
     There goes \usebox{\fullname}!  Ya da da da da da da.

One advantage of using and reusing a box register over a ‘\newcommand’
macro variable is efficiency, that LaTeX need not repeatedly retypeset
the contents.  See the example below.

   The first two command invocations shown above, ‘\sbox{BOX-CMD}{TEXT}’
and ‘\savebox{BOX-CMD}{TEXT}’, are roughly the same.  As to the third
and fourth, the optional arguments allow you to specify the box width as
WIDTH, and the position of the text inside that box as POSITION.  *Note
\mbox & \makebox::, for the full description.

   In the ‘\sbox’ and ‘\savebox’ commands the TEXT is typeset in LR mode
so it does not have line breaks (*note Modes::).  If you use these then
LaTeX doesn't give you an error but it ignores what you want: if you
enter ‘\sbox{\newreg}{test \\ test}’ and ‘\usebox{\newreg}’ then you get
‘testtest’, while if you enter ‘\sbox{\newreg}{test \par test}’ and
‘\usebox{\newreg}’ then you get ‘test test’, but no error or warning.
To fix this use a ‘\parbox’ or ‘minipage’ as here.

     \newsavebox{\areg}
     \savebox{\areg}{%
       \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
         \begin{enumerate}
           \item First item
           \item Second item
         \end{enumerate}
       \end{minipage}}
       ...
     \usebox{\areg}

   As an example of the efficiency of reusing a register's contents,
this puts the same picture on each page of the document by putting it in
the header.  LaTeX only typesets it once.

     \usepackage{graphicx}  % all this in the preamble
     \newsavebox{\sealreg}
     \savebox{\sealreg}{%
       \setlength{\unitlength}{1in}%
       \begin{picture}(0,0)%
          \put(1.5,-2.5){%
            \begin{tabular}{c}
               \includegraphics[height=2in]{companylogo.png} \\
               Office of the President
            \end{tabular}}
       \end{picture}%
     }
     \markright{\usebox{\sealreg}}
     \pagestyle{headings}

The ‘picture’ environment is good for fine-tuning the placement.

   If the register ‘\noreg’ has not already been defined then you get
something like ‘Undefined control sequence. <argument> \noreg’.

20.6 ‘lrbox’
============

Synopsis:

   This is the environment form of the ‘\sbox’ and ‘\savebox’ commands,
and is equivalent to them.  *Note \sbox & \savebox::, for the full
description.

   The TEXT inside the environment is saved in the box register referred
to by variable ‘BOX-CMD’.  The variable name BOX-CMD must begin with a
backslash, ‘\’.  You must allocate this box register in advance with
‘\newsavebox’ (*note \newsavebox::).  In this example the environment is
convenient for entering the ‘tabular’.

     \newsavebox{\jhreg}
     \begin{lrbox}{\jhreg}
       \begin{tabular}{c}
         \includegraphics[height=1in]{jh.png} \\

more information and examples, *note \sbox & \savebox::.  (Note that the
variable name BOX-CMD starts with a backslash, ‘\’.)  This command is

21 Graphics
***********

You can use graphics such as PNG or PDF files in your LaTeX document.
You need an additional package, which comes standard with LaTeX.  This
example is the short how-to.

     \include{graphicx}  % goes in the preamble
       ...
     \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plot.pdf}

   To use the commands described here your document preamble must
contain either ‘\usepackage{graphicx}’ or ‘\usepackage{graphics}’.  Most
of the time, ‘graphicx’ is the better choice.

   Graphics come in two main types, raster and vector.  LaTeX can use
both.  In raster graphics the file contains an entry for each location
in an array, describing what color it is.  An example is a photograph in
JPG format.  In vector graphics, the file contains a list of
instructions such as ‘draw a circle with this radius and that center’.
An example is a line drawing produced by the Asymptote program, in PDF
format.  Generally vector graphics are more useful because you can
rescale their size without pixelation or other problems, and because
they often have a smaller size.

   There are systems particularly well-suited to make graphics for a
LaTeX document.  For example, these allow you to use the same fonts as
in your document.  LaTeX comes with a ‘picture’ environment (*note
picture::) that has simple capabilities.  Besides that, there are other
ways to include the graphic-making commands in the document.  Two such
systems are the PSTricks and TikZ packages.  There are also systems
external to LaTeX, that generate a graphic that you include using the
commands of this chapter.  Two that use a programming language are
Asymptote and MetaPost.  One that uses a graphical interface is Xfig.
Full description of these systems is outside the scope of this document;
see their documentation on CTAN.

21.1 ‘graphics’ package options
===============================

Synopsis (must be in the document preamble):

     \usepackage[COMMA-SEPARATED OPTION LIST]{graphics}

or

     \usepackage[COMMA-SEPARATED OPTION LIST]{graphicx}

   The ‘graphicx’ package has a format for optional arguments to the
‘\includegraphics’ command that is convenient (it is the key-value
format), so it is the better choice for new documents.  When you load
the ‘graphics’ or ‘graphicx’ package with ‘\usepackage’ there are two
kinds of available options.

   The first is that LaTeX does not contain information about different
output systems but instead depends on information stored in a “printer
driver” file.  Normally you should not specify the driver option in the
document, and instead rely on your system's default.  One advantage of
this is that it makes the document portable across systems.

   For completeness here is a list of the drivers.  The currently
relevant ones are: ‘dvipdfmx’, ‘dvips’, ‘dvisvgm’, ‘luatex’, ‘pdftex’,
‘xetex’.  The two ‘xdvi’ and ‘oztex’ are essentially aliases for ‘dvips’
(and ‘xdvi’ is monochrome).  Ones that should not be used for new
systems are: ‘dvipdf’, ‘dvipdfm’, ‘dviwin’, ‘dvipsone’, ‘emtex’,
‘pctexps’, ‘pctexwin’, ‘pctexhp’, ‘pctex32’, ‘truetex’, ‘tcidvi’, ‘vtex’
(and ‘dviwindo’ is an alias for ‘dvipsone’).  These are stored in files
with a ‘.def’ extension, such as ‘pdftex.def’.

   The second kind of options are below.

‘demo’
     Instead of an image file, LaTeX puts in a 150 pt by 100 pt
     rectangle (unless another size is specified in the
     ‘\includegraphics’ command).

‘draft’
     For each graphic file, it is not shown but instead its file name is
     printed in a box of the correct size.  In order to determine the
     size, the file must be present.

‘final’
     (Default) Override any previous ‘draft’ option, so that the
     document shows the contents of the graphic files.

‘hiderotate’
     Do not show rotated text.  (This allows for the possibility that a
     previewer does not have the capability to rotate text.)

‘hidescale’
     Do not show scaled text.  (This allows for the possibility that a
     previewer does not have the capability to scale.)

‘hiresbb’
     In a PS or EPS file the graphic size may be specified in two ways.
     The ‘%%BoundingBox’ lines describe the graphic size using integer
     multiples of a PostScript point, that is, integer multiples of 1/72
     inch.  A later addition to the PostScript language allows decimal
     multiples, such as 1.23, in ‘%%HiResBoundingBox’ lines.  This
     option has LaTeX to read the size from the latter.

21.2 ‘graphics’ package configuration
=====================================

These commands configure the way LaTeX searches the file system for the
graphic.

   The behavior of file system search code is necessarily platform
dependent.  In this document we cover GNU/Linux, Macintosh, and Windows,
as those systems are typically configured.  For other situations consult
the documentation in ‘grfguide.pdf’, or the LaTeX source, or your TeX
distribution's documentation.

* Menu:

* \graphicspath::                Directories to search.
* \DeclareGraphicsExtensions::   File types, such as JPG or EPS.
* \DeclareGraphicsRule::         How to handle file types.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \graphicspath,  Next: \DeclareGraphicsExtensions,  Up: Graphics package configuration

21.2.1 ‘\graphicspath’
----------------------

Synopsis:

     \graphicspath{LIST OF DIRECTORIES INSIDE CURLY BRACES}

   Declare a list of directories to search for graphics files.  This
allows you to later say something like ‘\includegraphics{lion.png}’
instead of having to give its path.

   LaTeX always looks for graphic files first in the current directory
(and the output directory, if specified; *note output directory::).  The
declaration below tells the system to then look in the subdirectory
‘pix’, and then ‘../pix’.

     \usepackage{graphicx}   % or graphics; put in preamble
       ...
     \graphicspath{ {pix/} {../pix/} }

   The ‘\graphicspath’ declaration is optional.  If you don't include it
then LaTeX's default is to search all of the places that it usually
looks for a file (it uses LaTeX's ‘\input@path’).  In particular, in
this case one of the places it looks is the current directory.

   Enclose each directory name in curly braces; for example, above it
says ‘‘{pix}’’.  Do this even if there is only one directory.  Each
directory name must end in a forward slash, ‘/’.  This is true even on
Windows, where good practice is to use forward slashes for all the
directory separators since it makes the document portable to other
platforms.  If you have spaces in your directory name then use double
quotes, as with ‘{"my docs/"}’.  Getting one of these rules wrong will
cause LaTeX to report ‘Error: File `FILENAME' not found’.

   Basically, the algorithm is that with this example, after looking in
the current directory,

     \graphicspath{ {pix/} {../pix/} }
     ...
     \usepackage{lion.png}

for each of the listed directories, LaTeX concatenates it with the
filename and searches for the result, checking for ‘pix/lion.png’ and
then ‘../pix/lion.png’.  This algorithm means that the ‘\graphicspath’
command does not recursively search subdirectories: if you issue
‘\graphicspath{{a/}}’ and the graphic is in ‘a/b/lion.png’ then LaTeX
will not find it.  It also means that you can use absolute paths such as
‘\graphicspath{{/home/jim/logos/}}’ or
‘\graphicspath{{C:/Users/Albert/Pictures/}}’.  However, using these
means that the document is not portable.  (You could preserve
portability by adjusting your TeX system settings configuration file
parameter ‘TEXINPUTS’; see the documentation of your system.)

   You can use ‘\graphicspath’ anywhere in the document.  You can use it
more than once.  Show its value with
‘\makeatletter\typeout{\Ginput@path}\makeatother’.

   The directories are taken with respect to the base file.  That is,
suppose that you are working on a document based on ‘book/book.tex’ and
it contains ‘\include{chapters/chap1}’.  If in ‘chap1.tex’ you put
‘\graphicspath{{plots/}}’ then LaTeX will not search for graphics in
‘book/chapters/plots’, but instead in ‘book/plots’.

21.2.2 ‘\DeclareGraphicsExtensions’
-----------------------------------

Synopses:

     \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF FILE EXTENSIONS}

   Declare the filename extensions to try.  This allows you to specify
the order in which to choose graphic formats when you include graphic
files by giving the filename without the extension, as in
‘\includegraphics{functionplot}’.

   In this example, LaTeX will find files in the PNG format before PDF
files.

     \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png,PNG,.pdf,.PDF}
       ...
     \includegraphics{lion}   % will find lion.png before lion.pdf

Because the filename ‘lion’ does not have a period, LaTeX uses the
extension list.  For each directory in the graphics path (*note
\graphicspath::), LaTeX will try the extensions in the order given.  If
it does not find such a file after trying all the directories and
extensions then it reports ‘! LaTeX Error: File `‘lion’' not found’.
Note that you must include the periods at the start of the extensions.

   Because GNU/Linux and Macintosh filenames are case sensitive, the
list of file extensions is case sensitive on those platforms.  The
Windows platform is not case sensitive.

   You are not required to include ‘\DeclareGraphicsExtensions’ in your
document; the printer driver has a sensible default.  For example, the
most recent ‘pdftex.def’ has this extension list.

     .pdf,.png,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,.PDF,.PNG,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2

   To change the order, use the ‘grfext’ package.

   You can use this command anywhere in the document.  You can use it
more than once.  Show its value with
‘\makeatletter\typeout{\Gin@extensions}\makeatother’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \DeclareGraphicsRule,  Prev: \DeclareGraphicsExtensions,  Up: Graphics package configuration

21.2.3 ‘\DeclareGraphicsRule’
-----------------------------

Synopsis:

     \DeclareGraphicsRule{EXTENSION}{TYPE}{SIZE-FILE EXTENSION}{COMMAND}

   Declare how to handle graphic files whose names end in EXTENSION.

   This example declares that all files with names of the form
‘filename-without-dot.mps’ will be treated as output from MetaPost,
meaning that the printer driver will use its MetaPost-handling code to
input the file.

     \DeclareGraphicsRule{.mps}{mps}{.mps}{}

   This

     \DeclareGraphicsRule{*}{mps}{*}{}

tells LaTeX that it should handle as MetaPost output any file with an
extension not covered by another rule, so it covers ‘filename.1’,
‘filename.2’, etc.

   This describes the four arguments.

EXTENSION
     The file extension to which this rule applies.  The extension is
     anything after and including the first dot in the filename.  Use
     the Kleene star, ‘*’, to denote the default behavior for all
     undeclared extensions.

TYPE
     The type of file involved.  This type is a string that must be
     defined in the printer driver.  For instance, files with extensions
     ‘.ps’, ‘.eps’, or ‘.ps.gz’ may all be classed as type ‘eps’.  All
     files of the same type will be input with the same internal command
     by the printer driver.  For example, the file types that ‘pdftex’
     recognizes are: ‘jpg’, ‘jbig2’, ‘mps’, ‘pdf’, ‘png’, ‘tif’.

SIZE-FILE EXTENSION
     The extension of the file to be read to determine the size of the
     graphic, if there is such a file.  It may be the same as EXTENSION
     but it may be different.

     As an example, consider a PostScript graphic.  To make it smaller,
     it might be compressed into a ‘.ps.gz’ file.  Compressed files are
     not easily read by LaTeX so you can put the bounding box
     information in a separate file.  If SIZE-FILE EXTENSION is empty
     then you must specify size information in the arguments of
     ‘\includegraphics’.

     If the driver file has a procedure for reading size files for
     ‘type’ then that will be used, otherwise it will use the procedure
     for reading ‘.eps’ files.  (Thus you may specify the size of bitmap
     files in a file with a PostScript style ‘%%BoundingBox’ line if no
     other format is available.)

COMMAND
     A command that will be applied to the file.  This is often left
     empty.  This command must start with a single backward quote.
     Thus, ‘\DeclareGraphicsRule{.eps.gz}{eps}{.eps.bb}{`gunzip -c #1}’
     specifies that any file with the extension ‘.eps.gz’ should be
     treated as an ‘eps’ file, with the BoundingBox information stored
     in the file with extension ‘.eps.bb’, and that the command ‘gunzip
     -c’ will run on your platform to decompresses the file.

     Such a command is specific to your platform.  In addition, your TeX
     system must allow you to run external commands; as a security
     measure modern systems restrict running commands unless you
     explicitly allow it.  See the documentation for your TeX
     distribution.

21.3.1 ‘\includegraphics’
-------------------------

Synopses for ‘graphics’ package:

     \includegraphics{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics[URX,URY]{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics[LLX,LLY][URX,URY]{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics*{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics*[URX,URY]{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics*[LLX,LLY][URX,URY]{FILENAME}

   Synopses for ‘graphicx’ package:

     \includegraphics{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics[KEY-VALUE LIST]{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics*{FILENAME}
     \includegraphics*[KEY-VALUE LIST]{FILENAME}

   Include a graphics file.  The starred form ‘\includegraphics*’ will
clip the graphic to the size specified, while for the unstarred form any
part of the graphic that is outside the box of the specified size will
over-print the surrounding area.

   This

     \usepackage{graphicx}  % in preamble
       ...
     \begin{center}
       \includegraphics{plot.pdf}
     \end{center}

will incorporate into the document the graphic in ‘plot.pdf’, centered
and at its nominal size.  You can also give a path to the file, as with
‘\includegraphics{graphics/plot.pdf}’.  To specify a list of locations
to search for the file, *note \graphicspath::.

   If your filename includes spaces then put it in double quotes.  An
example is ‘\includegraphics{"sister picture.jpg"}’.

   The ‘\includegraphics{FILENAME}’ command decides on the type of
graphic by splitting FILENAME on the first dot.  You can instead use
FILENAME with no dot, as in ‘\includegraphics{turing}’, and then LaTeX
tries a sequence of extensions such as ‘.png’ and ‘.pdf’ until it finds
a file with that extension (*note \DeclareGraphicsExtensions::).

   If your file name contains dots before the extension then you can
hide them with curly braces, as in
‘\includegraphics{{plot.2018.03.12.a}.pdf}’.  Or, if you use the
‘graphicx’ package then you can use the options ‘type’ and ‘ext’; see
below.  This and other filename issues are also handled with the package
‘grffile’.

   This example puts a graphic in a ‘figure’ environment so LaTeX can
move it to the next page if fitting it on the current page is awkward
(*note figure::).

     \begin{figure}
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=3cm]{lungxray.jpg}
       \caption{The evidence is overwhelming: don't smoke.}  \label{fig:xray}
     \end{figure}

   This places a graphic that will not float, so it is sure to appear at
this point in the document even if makes LaTeX stretch the text or
resort to blank areas on the page.  It will be centered and will have a
caption.

     \usepackage{caption}  % in preamble
       ...
     \begin{center}
       \includegraphics{pix/nix.png}
       \captionof{figure}{The spirit of the night} \label{pix:nix} % optional
     \end{center}

   This example puts a box with a graphic side by side with one having
text, with the two vertically centered.

     \newcommand*{\vcenteredhbox}[1]{\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}#1\end{tabular}}
       ...
     \begin{center}
       \vcenteredhbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{plot}}
       \hspace{1em}
       \vcenteredhbox{\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}
                        \begin{displaymath}
                          f(x)=x\cdot \sin (1/x)
                        \end{displaymath}
                      \end{minipage}}
     \end{center}

   If you use the ‘graphics’ package then the only options involve the
size of the graphic (but see *note \rotatebox:: and *note \scalebox::).
When one optional argument is present then it is ‘[URX,URY]’ and it
gives the coordinates of the top right corner of the image, as a pair of
TeX dimensions (*note Units of length::).  If the units are omitted they
default to ‘bp’.  In this case, the lower left corner of the image is
assumed to be at (0,0).  If two optional arguments are present then the
leading one is ‘[LLX,LLY]’, specifying the coordinates of the image's
lower left.  Thus, ‘\includegraphics[1in,0.618in]{...}’ calls for the
graphic to be placed so it is 1 inch wide and 0.618 inches tall and so
its origin is at (0,0).

   The ‘graphicx’ package gives you many more options.  Specify them in
a key-value form, as here.

     \begin{center}
       \includegraphics[width=1in,angle=90]{lion}
       \hspace{2em}
       \includegraphics[angle=90,width=1in]{lion}
     \end{center}

The options are read left-to-right.  So the first graphic above is made
one inch wide and then rotated, while the second is rotated and then
made one inch wide.  Thus, unless the graphic is perfectly square, the
two will end with different widths and heights.

   There are many options.  The primary ones are listed first.

   Note that a graphic is placed by LaTeX into a box, which is
traditionally referred to as its “bounding box” (distinct from the
PostScript BoundingBox described below).  The graphic's printed area may
go beyond this box, or sit inside this box, but when LaTeX makes up a
page it puts together boxes and this is the box allocated for the
graphic.

‘width’
     The graphic will be shown so its bounding box is this width.  An
     example is ‘\includegraphics[width=1in]{plot}’.  You can use the
     standard TeX dimensions (*note Units of length::) and also
     convenient is ‘\linewidth’, or in a two-column document,
     ‘\columnwidth’ (*note Page layout parameters::).  An example is
     that by using the ‘calc’ package you can make the graphic be 1 cm
     narrower than the width of the text with
     ‘\includegraphics[width=\linewidth-1.0cm]{hefferon.jpg}’.

‘height’
     The graphic will be shown so its bounding box is this height.  You
     can use the standard TeX dimensions (*note Units of length::), and
     also convenient are ‘\pageheight’ and ‘\textheight’ (*note Page
     layout parameters::).  For instance, the command
     ‘\includegraphics[height=0.25\textheight]{godel}’ will make the
     graphic a quarter of the height of the text area.

‘totalheight’
     The graphic will be shown so its bounding box has this height plus
     depth.  This differs from the height if the graphic was rotated.
     For instance, if it has been rotated by -90 then it will have zero
     height but a large depth.

‘keepaspectratio’
     If set to ‘true’, or just specified as here

          \includegraphics[...,keepaspectratio,...]{...}

     and you give as options both ‘width’ and ‘height’ (or
     ‘totalheight’), then LaTeX will make the graphic is as large as
     possible without distortion.  That is, LaTeX will ensure that
     neither is the graphic wider than ‘width’ nor taller than ‘height’
     (or ‘totalheight’).

‘scale’
     Factor by which to scale the graphic.  To make a graphic twice its
     nominal size, enter ‘\includegraphics[scale=2.0]{...}’.  This
     number may be any value; a number between 0 and 1 will shrink the
     graphic and a negative number will reflect it.

‘angle’
     Rotate the graphic.  The angle is taken in degrees and
     counterclockwise.  The graphic is rotated about its ‘origin’; see
     that option.  For a complete description of how rotated material is
     typeset, *note \rotatebox::.

‘origin’
     The point of the graphic about which the rotation happens.
     Possible values are any string containing one or two of: ‘l’ for
     left, ‘r’ for right, ‘b’ for bottom, ‘c’ for center, ‘t’ for top,
     and ‘B’ for baseline.  Thus, entering the command
     ‘\includegraphics[angle=180,origin=c]{moon}’ will turn the picture
     upside down about that picture's center, while the command
     ‘\includegraphics[angle=180,origin=lB]{LeBateau}’ will turn its
     picture upside down about its left baseline.  (The character ‘c’
     gives the horizontal center in ‘bc’ or ‘tc’, but gives the vertical
     center in ‘lc’ or ‘rc’.)  The default is ‘lB’.

     To rotate about an arbitrary point, *note \rotatebox::.

   These are lesser-used options.

‘viewport’
     Pick out a subregion of the graphic to show.  Takes four arguments,
     separated by spaces and given in TeX dimensions, as with
     ‘\includegraphics[.., viewport=0in 0in 1in 0.618in]{...}’.  When
     the unit is omitted, the dimensions default to big points, ‘bp’.
     They are taken relative to the origin specified by the bounding
     box.  See also the ‘trim’ option.

‘trim’
     Gives parts of the graphic to not show.  Takes four arguments,
     separated by spaces, that are given in TeX dimensions, as with
     ‘\includegraphics[.., trim= 0in 0.1in 0.2in 0.3in, ...]{...}’.
     These give the amounts of the graphic not to show, that is, LaTeX
     will crop the picture by 0 inches on the left, 0.1 inches on the
     bottom, 0.2 inches on the right, and 0.3 inches on the top.  See
     also the ‘viewport’ option.

‘clip’
     If set to ‘true’, or just specified as here

          \includegraphics[...,clip,...]{...}

     then the graphic is cropped to the bounding box.  This is the same
     as using the starred form of the command,
     ‘\includegraphics*[...]{...}’.

‘page’
     Give the page number of a multi-page PDF file.  The default is
     ‘page=1’.

‘pagebox’
     Specifies which bounding box to use for PDF files from among
     ‘mediabox’, ‘cropbox’, ‘bleedbox’, ‘trimbox’, or ‘artbox’.  PDF
     files do not have the BoundingBox that PostScript files have, but
     may specify up to four predefined rectangles.  The MediaBox gives
     the boundaries of the physical medium.  The CropBox is the region
     to which the contents of the page are to be clipped when displayed.
     The BleedBox is the region to which the contents of the page should
     be clipped in production.  The TrimBox is the intended dimensions
     of the finished page.  The ArtBox is the extent of the page's
     meaningful content.  The driver will set the image size based on
     CropBox if present, otherwise it will not use one of the others,
     with a driver-defined order of preference.  MediaBox is always
     present.

‘interpolate’
     Enable or disable interpolation of raster images by the viewer.
     Can be set with ‘interpolate=true’ or just specified as here.

          \includegraphics[...,interpolate,...]{...}

‘quiet’
     Do not write information to the log.  You can set it with
     ‘quiet=true’ or just specified it with
     ‘\includegraphics[...,quiet,...]{...}’,

‘draft’
     If you set it with ‘draft=true’ or just specify it with

          \includegraphics[...,draft,...]{...}

     then the graphic will not appear in the document, possibly saving
     color printer ink.  Instead, LaTeX will put an empty box of the
     correct size with the filename printed in it.

   These options address the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript
graphic files, which have a size specified with a line ‘%%BoundingBox’
that appears in the file.  It has four values, giving the lower x
coordinate, lower y coordinate, upper x coordinate, and upper y
coordinate.  The units are PostScript points, equivalent to TeX's big
points, 1/72 inch.  For example, if an ‘.eps’ file has the line
‘%%BoundingBox 10 20 40 80’ then its natural size is 30/72 inch wide by
60/72 inch tall.

‘bb’
     Specify the bounding box of the displayed region.  The argument is
     four dimensions separated by spaces, as with ‘\includegraphics[..,
     bb= 0in 0in 1in 0.618in]{...}’.  Usually ‘\includegraphics’ reads
     the BoundingBox numbers from the EPS file automatically, so this
     option is only useful if the bounding box is missing from that file
     or if you want to change it.

‘bbllx, bblly, bburx, bbury’
     Set the bounding box.  These four are obsolete, but are retained
     for compatibility with old packages.

‘natwidth, natheight’
     An alternative for ‘bb’.  Setting

          \includegraphics[...,natwidth=1in,natheight=0.618in,...]{...}

     is the same as setting ‘bb=0 0 1in 0.618in’.

‘hiresbb’
     If set to ‘true’, or just specified as with

          \includegraphics[...,hiresbb,...]{...}

     then LaTeX will look for ‘%%HiResBoundingBox’ lines instead of
     ‘%%BoundingBox’ lines.  (The ‘BoundingBox’ lines use only natural
     numbers while the ‘HiResBoundingBox’ lines use decimals; both use
     units equivalent to TeX's big points, 1/72 inch.)  To override a
     prior setting of ‘true’, you can set it to ‘false’.

   These following options allow a user to override LaTeX's method of
choosing the graphic type based on the filename extension.  An example
is that ‘\includegraphics[type=png,ext=.xyz,read=.xyz]{lion}’ will read
the file ‘lion.xyz’ as though it were ‘lion.png’.  For more on these,
*note \DeclareGraphicsRule::.

‘type’
     Specify the graphics type.

‘ext’
     Specify the graphics extension.  Only use this in conjunction with
     the option ‘type’.

‘read’
     Specify the file extension of the read file.  Only use this in
     conjunction with the option ‘type’.

‘command’

21.3.2 ‘\rotatebox’
-------------------

Synopsis if you use the ‘graphics’ package:

     \rotatebox{ANGLE}{MATERIAL}

   Synopses if you use the ‘graphicx’ package:

     \rotatebox{ANGLE}{MATERIAL}
     \rotatebox[KEY-VALUE LIST]{ANGLE}{MATERIAL}

   Put MATERIAL in a box and rotate it ANGLE degrees counterclockwise.

   This example rotates the table column heads forty-five degrees.

     \begin{tabular}{ll}
       \rotatebox{45}{Character} &\rotatebox{45}{NATO phonetic}   \\
       A                         &AL-FAH  \\
       B                         &BRAH-VOH
     \end{tabular}

   The MATERIAL can be anything that goes in a box, including a graphic.

       \rotatebox[origin=c]{45}{\includegraphics[width=1in]{lion}}

   To place the rotated material, the first step is that LaTeX sets
MATERIAL in a box, with a reference point on the left baseline.  The
second step is the rotation, by default about the reference point.  The
third step is that LaTeX computes a box to bound the rotated material.
Fourth, LaTeX moves this box horizontally so that the left edge of this
new bounding box coincides with the left edge of the box from the first
step (they need not coincide vertically).  This new bounding box, in its
new position, is what LaTeX uses as the box when typesetting this
material.

   If you use the ‘graphics’ package then the rotation is about the
reference point of the box.  If you use the ‘graphicx’ package then
these are the options that can go in the KEY-VALUE LIST, but note that
you can get the same effect without needing this package, except for the
‘x’ and ‘y’ options (*note \includegraphics::).

‘origin’
     The point of the MATERIAL's box about which the rotation happens.
     Possible value is any string containing one or two of: ‘l’ for
     left, ‘r’ for right, ‘b’ for bottom, ‘c’ for center, ‘t’ for top,
     and ‘B’ for baseline.  Thus, the first line here

          \rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{moon}
          \rotatebox[origin=lB]{180}{LeBateau}

     will turn the picture upside down from the center while the second
     will turn its picture upside down about its left baseline.  (The
     character ‘c’ gives the horizontal center in ‘bc’ or ‘tc’ but gives
     the vertical center in ‘lc’ or ‘rc’, and gives both in ‘c’.)  The
     default is ‘lB’.

‘x, y’
     Specify an arbitrary point of rotation with ‘\rotatebox[x=TeX
     DIMENSION,y=TeX DIMENSION]{...}’ (*note Units of length::).  These
     give the offset from the box's reference point.

‘units’
     This key allows you to change the default of degrees
     counterclockwise.  Setting ‘units=-360’ changes the direction to
     degrees clockwise and setting ‘units=6.283185’ changes to radians
     counterclockwise.

21.3.3 ‘\scalebox’
------------------

Synopses:

     \scalebox{HORIZONTAL FACTOR}{MATERIAL}
     \scalebox{HORIZONTAL FACTOR}[VERTICAL FACTOR]{MATERIAL}
     \reflectbox{MATERIAL}

   Scale the MATERIAL.

   This example halves the size, both horizontally and vertically, of
the first text and doubles the size of the second.

     \scalebox{0.5}{DRINK ME} and \scalebox{2.0}{Eat Me}

   If you do not specify the optional VERTICAL FACTOR then it defaults
to the same value as the HORIZONTAL FACTOR.

   You can use this command to resize a graphic, as here.

     \scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{lion}}

If you use the ‘graphicx’ package then you can accomplish the same thing
with optional arguments to ‘\includegraphics’ (*note
\includegraphics::).

   The ‘\reflectbox’ command abbreviates ‘\scalebox{-1}[1]{MATERIAL}’.
Thus, ‘Able was I\reflectbox{Able was I}’ will show the phrase ‘Able was
I’ immediately followed by its mirror reflection against a vertical
axis.

21.3.4 ‘\resizebox’
-------------------

Synopses:

     \resizebox{HORIZONTAL LENGTH}{VERTICAL LENGTH}{MATERIAL}
     \resizebox*{HORIZONTAL LENGTH}{VERTICAL LENGTH}{MATERIAL}

   Given a size, such as ‘3cm’, transform MATERIAL to make it that size.
If either HORIZONTAL LENGTH or VERTICAL LENGTH is an exclamation
point ‘!’ then the other argument is used to determine a scale factor
for both directions.

   This example makes the graphic be a half inch wide and scales it
vertically by the same factor to keep it from being distorted.

     \resizebox{0.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{lion}}

   The unstarred form ‘\resizebox’ takes VERTICAL LENGTH to be the box's
height while the starred form ‘\resizebox*’ takes it to be height+depth.
For instance, make the text have a height+depth of a quarter-inch with
‘\resizebox*{!}{0.25in}{\parbox{3.5in}{This box has both height and
depth.}}’.

   You can use ‘\depth’, ‘\height’, ‘\totalheight’, and ‘\width’ to
refer to the original size of the box.  Thus, make the text two inches
wide but keep the original height with ‘\resizebox{2in}{\height}{Two
inches}’.

22 Color
********

You can add color to text, rules, etc.  You can also have color in a box
or on an entire page and write text on top of it.

   Color support comes as an additional package.  So put
‘\usepackage{color}’ in your document preamble to use the commands
described here.

   Many other packages also supplement LaTeX's color abilities.
Particularly worth mentioning is ‘xcolor’, which is widely used and
significantly extends the capabilities described here, including adding
‘HTML’ and ‘Hsb’ color models.

* Menu:

* Color package options::       Options when you load the standard package.
* Color models::                How colors are represented.
* Commands for color::          The available commands.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Color package options,  Next: Color models,  Up: Color

22.1 ‘color’ package options
============================

Synopsis (must be in the document preamble):

     \usepackage[COMMA-SEPARATED OPTION LIST]{color}

   When you load the ‘color’ package there are two kinds of available
options.

   The first specifies the “printer driver”.  LaTeX doesn't contain
information about different output systems but instead depends on
information stored in a file.  Normally you should not specify the
driver option in the document, and instead rely on your system's
default.  One advantage of this is that it makes the document portable
across systems.  For completeness we include a list of the drivers.  The
currently relevant ones are: ‘dvipdfmx’, ‘dvips’, ‘dvisvgm’, ‘luatex’,
‘pdftex’, ‘xetex’.  The two ‘xdvi’ and ‘oztex’ are essentially aliases
for ‘dvips’ (and ‘xdvi’ is monochrome).  Ones that should not be used
for new systems are: ‘dvipdf’, ‘dvipdfm’, ‘dviwin’, ‘dvipsone’, ‘emtex’,
‘pctexps’, ‘pctexwin’, ‘pctexhp’, ‘pctex32’, ‘truetex’, ‘tcidvi’, ‘vtex’
(and ‘dviwindo’ is an alias for ‘dvipsone’).

   The second kind of options, beyond the drivers, are below.

‘monochrome’
     Disable the color commands, so that they do not generate errors but
     do not generate color either.

‘dvipsnames’
     Make available a list of 68 color names that are often used,
     particularly in legacy documents.  These color names were
     originally provided by the ‘dvips’ driver, giving the option name.

‘nodvipsnames’
     Do not load that list of color names, saving LaTeX a tiny amount of
     memory space.

22.2 Color models
=================

A “color model” is a way of representing colors.  LaTeX's capabilities
depend on the printer driver.  However, the ‘pdftex’, ‘xetex’, and
‘luatex’ printer drivers are today by far the most commonly used.  The
models below work for those drivers.  All but one of these is also
supported by essentially all other printer drivers used today.

   Note that color combination can be additive or subtractive.  Additive
mixes colors of light, so that for instance combining full intensities
of red, green, and blue produces white.  Subtractive mixes pigments,
such as with inks, so that combining full intensity of cyan, magenta,
and yellow makes black.

‘cmyk’
     A comma-separated list with four real numbers between 0 and 1,
     inclusive.  The first number is the intensity of cyan, the second
     is magenta, and the others are yellow and black.  A number value of
     0 means minimal intensity, while a 1 is for full intensity.  This
     model is often used in color printing.  It is a subtractive model.

‘gray’
     A single real number between 0 and 1, inclusive.  The colors are
     shades of grey.  The number 0 produces black while 1 gives white.

‘rgb’
     A comma-separated list with three real numbers between 0 and 1,
     inclusive.  The first number is the intensity of the red component,
     the second is green, and the third the blue.  A number value of 0
     means that none of that component is added in, while a 1 means full
     intensity.  This is an additive model.

‘RGB’
     (‘pdftex’, ‘xetex’, ‘luatex’ drivers) A comma-separated list with
     three integers between 0 and 255, inclusive.  This model is a
     convenience for using ‘rgb’ since outside of LaTeX colors are often
     described in a red-green-blue model using numbers in this range.
     The values entered here are converted to the ‘rgb’ model by
     dividing by 255.

‘named’
     Colors are accessed by name, such as ‘PrussianBlue’.  The list of
     names depends on the driver, but all support the names ‘black’,
     ‘blue’, ‘cyan’, ‘green’, ‘magenta’, ‘red’, ‘white’, and ‘yellow’
     (See the ‘dvipsnames’ option in *note Color package options::).

22.3 Commands for color
=======================

These are the commands available with the ‘color’ package.

* Menu:

* Define colors::            Give a color a name.
* Colored text::             Text or rules in color.
* Colored boxes::            A box of color, to write over.
* Colored pages::            A whole page colored.

22.3.1 Define colors
--------------------

Synopsis:

     \definecolor{NAME}{MODEL}{SPECIFICATION}

   Give the name NAME to the color.  For example, after this

     \definecolor{silver}{rgb}{0.75,0.75,0.74}

you can use that color name with ‘Hi ho, \textcolor{silver}{Silver}!’.

   This example gives the color a more abstract name, so it could change
and not be misleading.

     \definecolor{logocolor}{RGB}{145,92,131}    % RGB needs pdflatex
     \newcommand{\logo}{\textcolor{logocolor}{Bob's Big Bagels}}

   Often a document's colors are defined in the preamble, or in the
class or style, rather than in the document body.

22.3.2 Colored text
-------------------

Synopses:

     \textcolor{NAME}{...}
     \textcolor[COLOR MODEL]{COLOR SPECIFICATION}{...}

or

     \color{NAME}
     \color[COLOR MODEL]{COLOR SPECIFICATION}

   The affected text gets the color.  This line

     \textcolor{magenta}{My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;}
     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!

causes the first half to be in magenta while the rest is in black.  You
can use a color declared with ‘\definecolor’ in exactly the same way
that we just used the builtin color ‘magenta’.

     \definecolor{MidlifeCrisisRed}{rgb}{1.0,0.11,0.0}
     I'm thinking about getting a \textcolor{MidlifeCrisisRed}{sports car}.

   The two ‘\textcolor’ and ‘\color’ differ in that the first is a
command form, enclosing the text to be colored as an argument.  Often
this form is more convenient, or at least more explicit.  The second
form is a declaration, as in ‘The moon is made of {\color{green} green}
cheese’, so it is in effect until the end of the current group or
environment.  This is sometimes useful when writing macros or as below
where it colors everything inside the ‘center’ environment, including
the vertical and horizontal lines.

     \begin{center} \color{blue}
       \begin{tabular}{l|r}
         UL &UR \\ \hline
         LL &LR
       \end{tabular}
     \end{center}

   You can use color in equations.  A document might have this
definition in the preamble

     \definecolor{highlightcolor}{RGB}{225,15,0}

and then contain this equation.

     \begin{equation}
       \int_a^b \textcolor{highlightcolor}{f'(x)}\,dx=f(b)-f(a)
     \end{equation}

   Typically the colors used in a document are declared in a class or
style but sometimes you want a one-off.  Those are the second forms in
the synopses.

     Colors of \textcolor[rgb]{0.33,0.14,0.47}{Purple} and
     {\color[rgb]{0.72,0.60,0.37}Gold} for the team.

   The format of COLOR SPECIFICATION depends on the color model (*note
Color models::).  For instance, while ‘rgb’ takes three numbers, ‘gray’
takes only one.

     The selection was \textcolor[gray]{0.5}{grayed out}.

   Colors inside colors do not combine.  Thus

     \textcolor{green}{kind of \textcolor{blue}{blue}}

has a final word that is blue, not a combination of blue and green.

22.3.3 Colored boxes
--------------------

Synopses:

     \colorbox[MODEL NAME]{BOX BACKGROUND COLOR}{...}

or

     \fcolorbox{FRAME COLOR}{BOX BACKGROUND COLOR}{...}
     \fcolorbox[MODEL NAME]{FRAME COLOR}{BOX BACKGROUND COLOR}{...}

   Make a box with the stated background color.  The ‘\fcolorbox’
command puts a frame around the box.  For instance this

     Name:~\colorbox{cyan}{\makebox[5cm][l]{\strut}}

makes a cyan-colored box that is five centimeters long and gets its
depth and height from the ‘\strut’ (so the depth is ‘-.3\baselineskip’
and the height is ‘\baselineskip’).  This puts white text on a blue
background.

     \colorbox{blue}{\textcolor{white}{Welcome to the machine.}}

   The ‘\fcolorbox’ commands use the same parameters as ‘\fbox’ (*note
\fbox & \framebox::), ‘\fboxrule’ and ‘\fboxsep’, to set the thickness
of the rule and the boundary between the box interior and the
surrounding rule.  LaTeX's defaults are ‘0.4pt’ and ‘3pt’, respectively.

   This example changes the thickness of the border to 0.8 points.  Note
that it is surrounded by curly braces so that the change ends at the end
of the second line.

     {\setlength{\fboxrule}{0.8pt}
     \fcolorbox{black}{red}{Under no circumstances turn this knob.}}

pages, to the color.  For an explanation of the specification in the
second form *note Colored text::.  The third returns the background to
normal, which is a transparent background.  (If that is not supported
use ‘\pagecolor{white}’, although that will make a white background
rather than the default transparent background.)

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Printing special characters,  Next: Upper and lower case,  Up: Special insertions

23.1 Printing special characters
================================

LaTeX sets aside a few characters for special purposes; they are called
reserved characters or special characters.  Here they are:

     # $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \

   The meaning of all the special characters is given elsewhere in this
manual (*note Reserved characters::).

   If you want a reserved character to be printed as itself, in the text
body font, for all but the final three characters in that list simply
put a ‘\’ in front of the character.  Thus, typing ‘\$1.23’ will produce
‘$1.23’ in your output.

   As to the last three characters, to get a tilde in the text body font
use ‘\~{}’ (omitting the curly braces would result in the next character
receiving a tilde accent).  Similarly, to get a text body font
circumflex use ‘\^{}’.  To get a backslash in the font of the text body,
enter ‘\textbackslash{}’.

   To produce the reserved characters in a typewriter font, use
‘\verb!!’ as below (the ‘\newline’ in the example is there only to split
the lines in the output).

     \begin{center}
       \# \$ \% \& \{ \} \_ \~{} \^{} \textbackslash \newline
       \verb!# $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \!
     \end{center}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Upper and lower case,  Next: Symbols by font position,  Prev: Printing special characters,  Up: Special insertions

23.2 Upper and lower case
=========================

Synopsis:

     \uppercase{TEXT}
     \lowercase{TEXT}
     \MakeUppercase{TEXT}
     \MakeLowercase{TEXT}

   Change the case of characters.  The TeX primitive commands
‘\uppercase’ and ‘\lowercase’ are set up by default to work only with
the 26 letters a-z and A-Z. The LaTeX commands ‘\MakeUppercase’ and
‘\MakeLowercase’ commands also change characters accessed by commands
such as ‘\ae’ or ‘\aa’.  The commands ‘\MakeUppercase’ and
‘\MakeLowercase’ are robust but they have moving arguments (*note
\protect::).

   These commands do not change the case of letters used in the name of
a command within TEXT.  But they do change the case of every other Latin
letter inside the argument TEXT.  Thus, ‘\MakeUppercase{Let $y=f(x)$’}
produces ‘LET Y=F(X)’.  Another example is that the name of an
environment will be changed, so that ‘\MakeUppercase{\begin{tabular} ...
\end{tabular}}’ will produce an error because the first half is changed
to ‘\begin{TABULAR}’.

   LaTeX uses the same fixed table for changing case throughout a
document, The table used is designed for the font encoding T1; this
works well with the standard TeX fonts for all Latin alphabets but will
cause problems when using other alphabets.

   To change the case of text that results from a macro inside TEXT you
need to do expansion.  Here the ‘\Schoolname’ produces ‘COLLEGE OF
MATHEMATICS’.

     \newcommand{\schoolname}{College of Mathematics}
     \newcommand{\Schoolname}{\expandafter\MakeUppercase
                                \expandafter{\schoolname}}

   The ‘textcase’ package brings some of the missing feature of the
standard LaTeX commands ‘\MakeUppercase’ and ‘\MakeLowerCase’.

   To uppercase only the first letter of words, you can use the package
‘mfirstuc’.

   Handling all the casing rules specified by Unicode, e.g., for
non-Latin scripts, is a much bigger job than anything envisioned in the
original TeX and LaTeX.  It has been implemented in the ‘expl3’ package
as of 2020.  The article "Case changing: From TeX primitives to the
Unicode algorithm", (Joseph Wright, ‘TUGboat’ 41:1,
<https://tug.org/TUGboat/tb41-1/tb127wright-case.pdf>), gives a good
overview of the topic, past and present.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Symbols by font position,  Next: Text symbols,  Prev: Upper and lower case,  Up: Special insertions

23.3 Symbols by font position
=============================

You can access any character of the current font using its number with
the ‘\symbol’ command.  For example, the visible space character used in
the ‘\verb*’ command has the code decimal 32 in the standard Computer
Modern typewriter font, so it can be typed as ‘\symbol{32}’.

   You can also specify numbers in octal (base 8) by using a ‘'’ prefix,
or hexadecimal (base 16) with a ‘"’ prefix, so the visible space at 32
decimal could also be written as ‘\symbol{'40}’ or ‘\symbol{"20}’.

23.4 Text symbols
=================

LaTeX provides commands to generate a number of non-letter symbols in
running text.  Some of these, especially the more obscure ones, are not
available in OT1.  As of the LaTeX February 2020 release, all symbols
are available by default; before that, it was necessary to use the
‘textcomp’ package for some (technically, those in the ‘TS1’ font
encoding).

‘\copyright’
‘\textcopyright’
     © The copyright symbol.

‘\dag’
     † The dagger symbol (in text).

‘\ddag’
     ‡ The double dagger symbol (in text).

‘\LaTeX’
     The LaTeX logo.

‘\LaTeXe’
     The LaTeX2e logo.

‘\guillemetleft («)’
‘\guillemetright (»)’
‘\guillemotleft («)’
‘\guillemotright (»)’
‘\guilsinglleft (‹)’
‘\guilsinglright (›)’
     «, », ‹, › Double and single angle quotation marks, commonly used
     in French.  The commands ‘@guillemotleft’ and ‘@guillemotright’ are
     synonyms for ‘@guillemet...’; these are misspellings inherited from
     Adobe.  (Guillemots are seabirds; guillemets are French quotes.)

‘\ldots’
‘\textellipsis’
‘\dots’
     ... An ellipsis (three dots at the baseline): ‘\ldots’ and ‘\dots’
     also work in math mode (*note Dots::).  See that math mode ellipsis
     description for additional general information.

‘\lq’
     ' Left (opening) quote.

‘\P’
‘\textparagraph’
     ¶ Paragraph sign (pilcrow).

‘\pounds’
‘\textsterling’
     £ English pounds sterling.

‘\quotedblbase („)’
‘\quotesinglbase (‚)’
     „ and ‚ Double and single quotation marks on the baseline.

‘\rq’
     ' Right (closing) quote.

‘\S’
‘\textsection’
     § Section sign.

‘\TeX’
     The TeX logo.

‘\textasciicircum’
     ^ ASCII circumflex.

‘\textasciitilde’
     ~ ASCII tilde.

‘\textasteriskcentered’
     * Centered asterisk.

‘\textbackslash’
     \ Backslash.  However, ‘\texttt{\textbackslash}’ produces a roman
     (not typewriter) backslash by default; for a typewriter backslash,
     it is necessary to use the T1 (or other non-default) font encoding,
     as in:

          \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

‘\textbar’
     | Vertical bar.

‘\textbardbl’
     ⏸ Double vertical bar.

‘\textbigcircle’
     ◯, Big circle symbol.

‘\textbraceleft’
     { Left brace.  See remarks at ‘\textbackslash’ above about making
     ‘\texttt{\textbraceleft}’ produce a typewriter brace.

‘\textbraceright’
     } Right brace.  See remarks at ‘\textbackslash’ above about making
     ‘\texttt{\textbraceright}’ produce a typewriter brace.

‘\textbullet’
     • Bullet.

‘\textcircled{LETTER}’
     Ⓐ, Circle around LETTER.

‘\textcompwordmark’
‘\textcapitalcompwordmark’
‘\textascendercompwordmark’
     Used to separate letters that would normally ligature.  For
     example, ‘f\textcompwordmark i’ produces ‘fi’ without a ligature.
     This is most useful in non-English languages.  The
     ‘\textcapitalcompwordmark’ form has the cap height of the font
     while the ‘\textascendercompwordmark’ form has the ascender height.

‘\textdagger’
     † Dagger.

‘\textdaggerdbl’
     ‡ Double dagger.

‘\textdollar (or ‘\$’)’
     $ Dollar sign.

‘\textemdash (or ‘---’)’
     -- Em-dash.  Used for punctuation, usually similar to commas or
     parentheses, as in '‘The playoffs---if you're lucky enough to make
     the playoffs---are more like a sprint.’' Conventions for spacing
     around em-dashes vary widely.

‘\textendash (or ‘--’)’
     - En-dash.  Used for ranges, as in '‘see pages 12--14’'.

‘\texteuro’

     The Euro currency symbol: €.

     For an alternative glyph design, try the ‘eurosym’ package; also,
     most fonts nowadays come with their own Euro symbol (Unicode

23.5 Accents
============

LaTeX has wide support for many of the world's scripts and languages,
provided through the core ‘babel’ package, which supports pdfLaTeX,
XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.  The ‘polyglossia’ package provides similar
support with the latter two engines.

   This section does not cover that support.  It only lists the core
LaTeX commands for creating accented characters.  The ‘\capital...’
commands shown here produce alternative forms for use with capital
letters.  These are not available with OT1.

   Below, to make them easier to find, the accents are all illustrated
with lowercase ‘o’.

   Note that ‘\i’ produces a dotless i, and ‘\j’ produces a dotless j.
These are often used in place of their dotted counterparts when they are
accented.

‘\"’
‘\capitaldieresis’
     ö Umlaut (dieresis).

‘\'’
‘\capitalacute’
     ó Acute accent.

‘\.’
     ȯ Dot accent.

‘\=’
‘\capitalmacron’
     ō Macron (overbar) accent.

‘\^’
‘\capitalcircumflex’
     ô Circumflex (hat) accent.

‘\`’
‘\capitalgrave’
     ò Grave accent.

‘\~’
‘\capitaltilde’
     ñ Tilde accent.

‘\b’
     o̲ Bar accent underneath.

     Related to this, ‘\underbar{TEXT}’ produces a bar under TEXT.  The
     argument is always processed in LR mode (*note Modes::).  The bar
     is always a fixed position under the baseline, thus crossing
     through descenders.  See also ‘\underline’ in *note Over- and
     Underlining::.

‘\c’
‘\capitalcedilla’
     ç Cedilla accent underneath.

‘\d’
‘\capitaldotaccent’
     ọ Dot accent underneath.

‘\H’
‘\capitalhungarumlaut’
     ő Long Hungarian umlaut accent.

‘\k’
‘\capitalogonek’
     ǫ Ogonek.  Not available in the OT1 encoding.

‘\r’
‘\capitalring’
     o̊ Ring accent.

‘\t’
‘\capitaltie’
‘\newtie’
‘\capitalnewtie’
     Tie-after accent (used for transliterating from Cyrillic, such as
     in the ALA-LC romanization).  It expects that the argument has two
     characters.  The ‘\newtie’ form is centered in its box.

‘\u’
‘\capitalbreve’
     ŏ Breve accent.

‘\v’
‘\capitalcaron’
     ǒ Háček (check, caron) accent.

23.5.1 ‘\accent’
----------------

Synopsis:

     \accent NUMBER CHARACTER

   A TeX primitive command used to generate accented characters from
accent marks and letters.  The accent mark is selected by NUMBER, a
numeric argument, followed by a space and then a CHARACTER argument to
construct the accented character in the current font.

   These are accented ‘e’ characters.

     \accent18 e
     \accent20 e
     \accent21 e
     \accent22 e
     \accent23 e

The first is a grave, the second a caron, the third a breve, the fourth
a macron, and the fifth a ring above.

   The position of the accent is determined by the font designer and so
the outcome of ‘\accent’ use may differ between fonts.  In LaTeX it is
desirable to have glyphs for accented characters rather than building
them using ‘\accent’.  Using glyphs that already contain the accented
characters (as in T1 encoding) allows correct hyphenation whereas
‘\accent’ disables hyphenation (specifically with OT1 font encoding
where accented glyphs are absent).

   There can be an optional font change between NUMBER and CHARACTER.
Note also that this command sets the ‘\spacefactor’ to 1000 (*note
\spacefactor::).

   An unavoidable characteristic of some Cyrillic letters and the
majority of accented Cyrillic letters is that they must be assembled
from multiple elements (accents, modifiers, etc.)  while ‘\accent’
provides for a single accent mark and a single letter combination.
There are also cases where accents must appear between letters that
\accent does not support.  Still other cases exist where the letters I
and J have dots above their lowercase counterparts that conflict with
dotted accent marks.  The use of ‘\accent’ in these cases will not work
as it cannot analyze upper/lower case.

23.6 Additional Latin letters
=============================

Here are the basic LaTeX commands for inserting letters beyond A-Z that
extend the Latin alphabet, used primarily in languages other than
English.

‘\aa’
‘\AA’
     å and Å.

‘\ae’
‘\AE’
     æ and Æ.

‘\dh’
‘\DH’
     Icelandic letter eth: ð and Ð. Not available with OT1 encoding, you
     need the ‘fontenc’ package to select an alternate font encoding,
     such as T1.

‘\dj’
‘\DJ’
     Crossed d and D, a.k.a. capital and small letter d with stroke.
     Not available with OT1 encoding, you need the ‘fontenc’ package to
     select an alternate font encoding, such as T1.

‘\ij’
‘\IJ’
     ij and IJ (except somewhat closer together than appears here).

‘\l’
‘\L’
     ł and Ł.

‘\ng’
‘\NG’
     Lappish letter eng, also used in phonetics.

‘\o’
‘\O’
     ø and Ø.

‘\oe’
‘\OE’
     œ and Œ.

‘\ss’
‘\SS’
     ß and SS.

‘\th’
‘\TH’
     Icelandic letter thorn: þ and Þ. Not available with OT1 encoding,
     you need the ‘fontenc’ package to select an alternate font
     encoding, such as T1.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: inputenc package,  Next: \rule,  Prev: Additional Latin letters,  Up: Special insertions

23.7 ‘inputenc’ package
=======================

Synopsis:

     \usepackage[ENCODING-NAME]{inputenc}

   Declare the input file's text encoding to be ENCODING-NAME.  (For
basic background, *note Input encodings::).  The default, if this
package is not loaded, is UTF-8.  Technically, specifying the encoding
name is optional, but in practice it is not useful to omit it.

   The ‘inputenc’ package tells LaTeX what encoding is used.  For
instance, the following command explicitly says that the input file is
UTF-8 (note the lack of a dash).

     \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

   The most common values for ENCODING-NAME are: ‘ascii’, ‘latin1’,
‘latin2’, ‘latin3’, ‘latin4’, ‘latin5’, ‘latin9’, ‘latin10’, ‘utf8’.

   Caution: use ‘inputenc’ only with the pdfTeX engine (*note TeX
engines::); with ‘xelatex’ or ‘lualatex’, declaring a non-UTF-8 encoding
with ‘inputenc’, such as ‘latin1’, will get the error ‘inputenc is not
designed for xetex or luatex’.

   An ‘inputenc’ package error such as ‘Invalid UTF-8 byte "96’ means
that some of the material in the input file does not follow the encoding
scheme.  Often these errors come from copying material from a document
that uses a different encoding than the input file.  The simplest
solution is often to replace the non-UTF-8 character with a UTF-8 or
LaTeX equivalent.

   If you need to process a non-UTF-8 document with LuaTeX, you can use
the ‘luainputenc’ package (<https://ctan.org/pkg/luainputenc>).  With
XeTeX, the ‘\XeTeXinputencoding’ and ‘\XeTeXdefaultencoding’ primitives
can be used (for an explanation and examples, see
<https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/324948>).

   It's also possible to re-encode a document from an 8-bit encoding to
UTF-8 outside of TeX, using system utilities.  For example, ‘recode
latin1..utf8’ or ‘iconv -f latin1 -t utf8’.

   In a few documents, such as a collection of journal articles from a
variety of authors, changing the encoding in mid-document may be
necessary.  You can use the command ‘\inputencoding{ENCODING-NAME}’ for
this.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \rule,  Next: \today,  Prev: inputenc package,  Up: Special insertions

23.8 ‘\rule’
============

Synopsis, one of:

     \rule{WIDTH}{THICKNESS}
     \rule[RAISE]{WIDTH}{THICKNESS}

   Produce a “rule”, a filled-in rectangle.

   This example produces a rectangular blob, sometimes called a Halmos
symbol, or just "qed", often used to mark the end of a proof:

     \newcommand{\qedsymbol}{\rule{0.4em}{2ex}}

The ‘amsthm’ package includes this command, with a somewhat
different-looking symbol.

   The mandatory arguments give the horizontal WIDTH and vertical
THICKNESS of the rectangle.  They are rigid lengths (*note Lengths::).
The optional argument RAISE is also a rigid length, and tells LaTeX how
much to raise the rule above the baseline, or lower it if the length is
negative.

   This produces a line, a rectangle that is wide but not tall.

     \noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

The line is the width of the page and 0.4 points tall.  This line
thickness is common in LaTeX.

   A rule that has zero width, or zero thickness, will not show up in
the output, but can cause LaTeX to change the output around it.  *Note
\strut::, for examples.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \today,  Prev: \rule,  Up: Special insertions

23.9 ‘\today’
=============

Synopsis:

     \today

   Produce today's date in the format ‘MONTH DD, YYYY’.  An example of a
date in that format is ‘July 4, 1976’.

   Multilingual packages such as ‘babel’ or ‘polyglossia’, or classes
such as ‘lettre’, will localize ‘\today’.  For example, the following
will output ‘4 juillet 1976’:

     \year=1976 \month=7 \day=4
     \documentclass{minimal}
     \usepackage[french]{babel}
     \begin{document}
     \today
     \end{document}

‘\today’ uses the counters ‘\day’, ‘\month’, and ‘\year’ (*note \day &
\month & \year::).

   A number of package on CTAN work with dates.  One is ‘datetime’
package which can produce a wide variety of date formats, including ISO
standards.

   The date is not updated as the LaTeX process runs, so in principle
the date could be incorrect by the time the program finishes.

24 Splitting the input
**********************

LaTeX lets you split a large document into several smaller ones.  This
can simplify editing or allow multiple authors to work on the document.
It can also speed processing.

   Regardless of how many separate files you use, there is always one
“root file”, on which LaTeX compilation starts.  This shows such a file
with five included files.

     \documentclass{book}
     \includeonly{  % comment out lines below to omit compiling
       pref,
       chap1,
       chap2,
       append,
       bib
       }
     \begin{document}
     \frontmatter
     \include{pref}
     \mainmatter
     \include{chap1}
     \include{chap2}
     \appendix
     \include{append}
     \backmatter
     \include{bib}
     \end{document}

This will bring in material from ‘pref.tex’, ‘chap1.tex’, ‘chap2.tex’,
‘append.tex’, and ‘bib.tex’.  If you compile this file, and then comment
out all of the lines inside ‘\includeonly{...}’ except for ‘chap1’, and
compile again, then LaTeX will only process the material in the first
chapter.  Thus, your output will appear more quickly and be shorter to
print.  However, the advantage of the ‘\includeonly’ command is that
LaTeX will retain the page numbers and all of the cross reference
information from the other parts of the document so these will appear in
your output correctly.

   *Note Larger book template::, for another example of ‘\includeonly’.

* Menu:

* \endinput::                 Stop including material from a file.
* \include & \includeonly::   Conditionally include files.
* \input::                    Unconditionally include a file.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \endinput,  Next: \include & \includeonly,  Up: Splitting the input

24.1 ‘\endinput’
================

Synopsis:

     \endinput

   When you ‘\include{filename}’, inside ‘filename.tex’ the material
after ‘\endinput’ will not be included.  This command is optional; if
‘filename.tex’ has no ‘\endinput’ then LaTeX will read all of the file.

   For example, suppose that a document's root file has ‘\input{chap1}’
and this is ‘chap1.tex’.

     \chapter{One}
     This material will appear in the document.
     \endinput
     This will not appear.

   This can be useful for putting documentation or comments at the end
of a file, or for avoiding junk characters that can be added if the file
is transmitted in the body of an email.  It is also useful for
debugging: one strategy to localize errors is to put ‘\endinput’ halfway
through the included file and see if the error disappears.  Now, knowing
which half contains the error, moving ‘\endinput’ to halfway through
that area further narrows down the location.  This process rapidly finds
the offending line.

   After reading ‘\endinput’, LaTeX continues to read to the end of the
line, so something can follow this command and be read nonetheless.
This allows you, for instance, to close an ‘\if...’ with a ‘\fi’.

24.2 ‘\include’ & ‘\includeonly’
================================

Synopsis:

     \includeonly{  % in document preamble
       ...
       FILENAME,
       ...
       }
       ...
     \include{FILENAME}  % in document body

   Bring material from the external file ‘FILENAME.tex’ into a LaTeX
document.

   The ‘\include’ command does three things: it executes ‘\clearpage’
(*note \clearpage & \cleardoublepage::), then it inputs the material
from ‘FILENAME.tex’ into the document, and then it does another
‘\clearpage’.  This command can only appear in the document body.

   The ‘\includeonly’ command controls which files will be read by LaTeX
under subsequent ‘\include’ commands.  Its list of filenames is
comma-separated.  It must appear in the preamble or even earlier, e.g.,
the command line; it can't appear in the document body.

   This example root document, ‘constitution.tex’, brings in three
files, ‘preamble.tex’, ‘articles.tex’, and ‘amendments.tex’.

     \documentclass{book}
     \includeonly{
       preamble,
       articles,
       amendments
       }
     \begin{document}
     \include{preamble}
     \include{articles}
     \include{amendments}
     \end{document}

The file ‘preamble.tex’ contains no special code; you have just
excerpted the chapter from ‘consitution.tex’ and put it in a separate
file just for editing convenience.

     \chapter{Preamble}
     We the People of the United States,
     in Order to form a more perfect Union, ...

Running LaTeX on ‘constitution.tex’ makes the material from the three
files appear in the document but also generates the auxiliary files
‘preamble.aux’, ‘articles.aux’, and ‘amendments.aux’.  These contain
information such as page numbers and cross-references (*note Cross
references::).  If you now comment out ‘\includeonly’'s lines with
‘preamble’ and ‘amendments’ and run LaTeX again then the resulting
document shows only the material from ‘articles.tex’, not the material
from ‘preamble.tex’ or ‘amendments.tex’.  Nonetheless, all of the
auxiliary information from the omitted files is still there, including
the starting page number of the chapter.

   If the document preamble does not have ‘\includeonly’ then LaTeX will
include all the files you call for with ‘\include’ commands.

   The ‘\include’ command makes a new page.  To avoid that, see *note
\input:: (which, however, does not retain the auxiliary information).

   *Note Larger book template::, for another example using ‘\include’
and ‘\includeonly’.  That example also uses ‘\input’ for some material
that will not necessarily start on a new page.

   File names can involve paths.

     \documentclass{book}
     \includeonly{
       chapters/chap1,
       }
     \begin{document}
     \include{chapters/chap1}
     \end{document}

   To make your document portable across distributions and platforms you
should avoid spaces in the file names.  The tradition is to instead use
dashes or underscores.  Nevertheless, for the name ‘amo amas amat’, this
works under TeX Live on GNU/Linux:

     \documentclass{book}
     \includeonly{
       "amo\space amas\space amat"
       }
     \begin{document}
     \include{"amo\space amas\space amat"}
     \end{document}

   and this works under MiKTeX on Windows:

     \documentclass{book}
     \includeonly{
       {"amo amas amat"}
       }
     \begin{document}
     \include{{"amo amas amat"}}
     \end{document}

   You cannot use ‘\include’ inside a file that is being included or you
get ‘LaTeX Error: \include cannot be nested.’ The ‘\include’ command
cannot appear in the document preamble; you will get ‘LaTeX Error:
Missing \begin{document}’.

   If a file that you ‘\include’ does not exist, for instance if you
‘\include{athiesm}’ but you meant ‘\include{atheism}’, then LaTeX does
not give you an error but will warn you ‘No file athiesm.tex.’ (It will
also create ‘athiesm.aux’.)

   If you ‘\include’ the root file in itself then you first get ‘LaTeX
Error: Can be used only in preamble.’ Later runs get ‘TeX capacity
exceeded, sorry [text input levels=15]’.  To fix this, you must remove
the inclusion ‘\include{ROOT}’ but also delete the file ‘ROOT.aux’ and
rerun LaTeX.

24.3 ‘\input’
=============

Synopsis:

     \input{FILENAME}

   LaTeX processes the file as if its contents were inserted in the
current file.  For a more sophisticated inclusion mechanism see *note
\include & \includeonly::.

   If FILENAME does not end in ‘.tex’ then LaTeX first tries the
filename with that extension; this is the usual case.  If FILENAME ends
with ‘.tex’ then LaTeX looks for the filename as it is.

   For example, this

     \input{macros}

will cause LaTeX to first look for ‘macros.tex’.  If it finds that file
then it processes its contents as thought they had been copy-pasted in.
If there is no file of the name ‘macros.tex’ then LaTeX tries the name
‘macros’, without an extension.  (This may vary by distribution.)

   To make your document portable across distributions and platforms you
should avoid spaces in the file names.  The tradition is to instead use
dashes or underscores.  Nevertheless, for the name ‘amo amas amat’, this
works under TeX Live on GNU/Linux:

     \input{"amo\space amas\space amat"}

   and this works under MiKTeX on Windows:

25.1 Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables
=======================================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \tableofcontents
     \listoffigures
     \listoftables

   Produce a table of contents, or list of figures, or list of tables.
Put the command in the input file where you want the table or list to
go.  You do not type the entries; for example, typically the table of
contents entries are automatically generated from the sectioning
commands ‘\chapter’, etc.

   This example illustrates the first command, ‘\tableofcontents’.
LaTeX will produce a table of contents on the book's first page.

     \documentclass{book}
     % \setcounter{tocdepth}{1}
     \begin{document}
     \tableofcontents\newpage
       ...
     \chapter{...}
       ...
     \section{...}
       ...
     \subsection{...}
       ...
     \end{document}

Uncommenting the second line would cause that table to contain chapter
and section listings but not subsection listings, because the ‘\section’
command has level 1.  *Note Sectioning::, for level numbers of the
sectioning units.  For more on the ‘tocdepth’ *note
Sectioning/tocdepth::.

   Another example of the use of ‘\tableofcontents’ is in *note Larger
book template::.

   If you want a page break after the table of contents, write a
‘\newpage’ command after the ‘\tableofcontents’ command, as above.

   To make the table of contents, LaTeX stores the information in an
auxiliary file named ‘ROOT-FILE.toc’ (*note Splitting the input::).  For
example, this LaTeX file ‘test.tex’

     \documentclass{article}
     \begin{document}
     \tableofcontents\newpage
     \section{First section}
     \subsection{First subsection}
       ...

writes these lines to ‘test.toc’.

     \contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}First section}{2}
     \contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {1.1}First subsection}{2}

Each line contains a single command, ‘\contentsline’ (*note
\contentsline::).  The first argument, the ‘section’ or ‘subsection’, is
the sectioning unit.  The second argument has two components.  The hook
‘\numberline’ determines how the sectioning number, ‘1’ or ‘1.1’,
appears in the table of contents (*note \numberline::).  The remainder
of the second argument of ‘\contentsline’, ‘First section’ or ‘First
subsection’, is the sectioning title text.  Finally, the third argument,
‘2’, is the page number on which this sectioning unit starts.

   To typeset these lines, the document class provides ‘\l@SECTION-UNIT’
commands such as ‘\l@section{TEXT}{PAGENUMBER}’ and
‘\l@subsection{TEXT}{PAGENUMBER}’.  These commands often use the
‘\@dottedtocline’ command (*note \@dottedtocline::).

   A consequence of LaTeX's strategy of using auxiliary files is that to
get the correct information in the document you must run LaTeX twice,
once to store the information and the second time to retrieve it.  In
the ordinary course of writing a document authors run LaTeX a number of
times, but you may notice that the first time that you compile a new
document, the table of contents page will be empty except for its
‘Contents’ header.  Just run LaTeX again.

   The commands ‘\listoffigures’ and ‘\listoftables’ produce a list of
figures and a list of tables.  Their information is stored in files with
extension ‘.lof’ and ‘.lot’.  They work the same way as
‘\tableofcontents’ but the latter is more common, so we use it for most
examples.

   You can manually add material to the table of contents, the list of
figures, and the list of tables.  For instance, add a line about a
section to the table of contents with
‘\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{TEXT}’.  (*note \addcontentsline::).
Add arbitrary material, that is, non-line material, with
‘\addtocontents’, as with the command
‘\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\vspace{2ex}}’, which adds vertical space
to the list of figures (*note \addtocontents::).

   Lines in the table of contents, the list of figures, and the list of
tables, have four parts.  First is an indent.  Next is a box into which
sectioning numbers are placed, and then the third box holds the title
text, such as ‘First section’.  Finally there is a box up against the
right margin, inside of which LaTeX puts the page number box.  For the
indent and the width of the number box, *note \@dottedtocline::.  The
right margin box has width ‘\@tocrmarg’ and the page number is flush
right in that space, inside a box of width ‘\@pnumwidth’.  By default
‘\@tocrmarg’ is ‘2.55em’ and ‘\@pnumwidth’ is ‘1.55em’.  Change these as
with ‘\renewcommand{\@tocrmarg}{3.5em}’.

   CTAN has many packages for the table of contents and lists of figures
and tables (*note CTAN::).  The package ‘tocloft’ is convenient for
adjusting some aspects of the default such as spacing.  And,
‘tocbibbind’ will automatically add the bibliography, index, etc.  to
the table of contents.

   To change the header for the table of contents page, do something
like these commands before you call ‘\tableofcontents’, etc.

     \renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}
     \renewcommand{\listfigurename}{Plots}
     \renewcommand{\listtablename}{Specifications}

   Internationalization packages such as ‘babel’ or ‘polyglossia’ will
change these headers depending on the chosen base language.

25.1.1 ‘\@dottedtocline’
------------------------

Synopsis:

     \@dottedtocline{SECTION-LEVEL-NUM}{INDENT}{NUMWIDTH}{TEXT}{PAGENUMBER}

   Used internally by LaTeX to format an entry line in the table of
contents, list of figures, or list of tables.  Authors do not directly
enter ‘\@dottedtocline’ commands.

   This command is typically used by ‘\l@section’, ‘\l@subsection’,
etc., to format the content lines.  For example, the ‘article.cls’ file
contains these definitions:

     \newcommand*\l@section{\@dottedtocline{1}{1.5em}{2.3em}}
     \newcommand*\l@subsection{\@dottedtocline{2}{3.8em}{3.2em}}
     \newcommand*\l@subsubsection{\@dottedtocline{3}{7.0em}{4.1em}}

In this example, ‘\@dottedcline’ appears to have been given only three
arguments.  But tracing the internal code shows that it picks up the
final TEXT and PAGENUMBER arguments in the synopsis from a call to
‘\contentsline’ (*note \contentsline::).

   Between the box for the title text of a section and the right margin
box, these ‘\@dottedtocline’ commands insert “leaders”, that is,
evenly-spaced dots.  The dot-to-dot space is given by the command
‘\@dotsep’.  By default it is 4.5 (it is in math units, aka. ‘mu’, which
are ‘1/18’ em.  Change it using ‘\renewcommand’, as in
‘\renewcommand{\@dotsep}{3.5}’.

   In the standard ‘book’ class, LaTeX does not use dotted leaders for
the Part and Chapter table entries, and in the standard ‘article’ class
it does not use dotted leaders for Section entries.

25.1.2 ‘\addcontentsline’
-------------------------

Synopsis:

     \addcontentsline{EXT}{UNIT}{TEXT}

   Add an entry to the auxiliary file with extension EXT.

   The following will result in an ‘Appendices’ line in the table of
contents.

     \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\textbf{Appendices}}

It will appear at the same indentation level as the sections, will be in
boldface, and will be assigned the page number associated with the point
where the command appears in the input file.

   The ‘\addcontentsline’ command writes information to the file
‘ROOT-NAME.EXT’, where ROOT-NAME is the file name of the root file
(*note Splitting the input::).  It writes that information as the text
of the command ‘\contentsline{UNIT}{TEXT}{NUM}’, where ‘NUM’ is the
current value of counter ‘UNIT’ (*note \contentsline::).  The most
common case is the table of contents and there NUM is the page number of
the first page of UNIT.

   This command is invoked by the sectioning commands ‘\chapter’, etc.
(*note Sectioning::), and also by ‘\caption’ inside a float environment
(*note Floats::).  But it is also directly used by authors.  For
example, an author writing a book whose style is to have an unnumbered
preface may use the starred ‘\chapter*’.  But that command leaves out
table of contents information, which can be entered manually, as here.

     \chapter*{Preface}
     \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\numberline{}Preface}

In the ‘ROOT-NAME.toc’ file LaTeX will put the line ‘\contentsline
{chapter}{\numberline {}Preface}{3}’; note that the page number ‘3’ is
automatically generated by the system, not entered manually.

   All of the arguments for ‘\addcontentsline’ are required.

EXT
     Typically one of the strings ‘toc’ for the table of contents, ‘lof’
     for the list of figures, or ‘lot’ for the list of tables.  The
     filename extension of the information file.

UNIT
     A string that depends on the value of the EXT argument, typically
     one of:

     ‘toc’
          For the table of contents, this is the name of a sectional
          unit: ‘part’, ‘chapter’, ‘section’, ‘subsection’, etc.

     ‘lof’
          For the list of figures: ‘figure’.

     ‘lot’
          For the list of tables: ‘table’.

TEXT
     The text of the entry.  You must ‘\protect’ any fragile commands
     (*note \protect::) used in it.

   The ‘\addcontentsline’ command has an interaction with ‘\include’
(*note \include & \includeonly::).  If you use them at the same level,
as with ‘\addcontentsline{...}{...}{...}\include{...}’ then lines in the
table of contents can come out in the wrong order.  The solution is to
move ‘\addcontentsline’ into the file being included.

   If you use a UNIT that LaTeX does not recognize, as with the typo
here

     \addcontentsline{toc}{setcion}{\protect\textbf{Appendices}}

then you don't get an error but the formatting in the table of contents
will not make sense.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addtocontents,  Next: \contentsline,  Prev: \addcontentsline,  Up: Table of contents etc.

25.1.3 ‘\addtocontents’
-----------------------

Synopsis:

     \addtocontents{EXT}{TEXT}

   Add TEXT, which may be text or formatting commands, directly to the
auxiliary file with extension EXT.  This is most commonly used for the
table of contents so that is the discussion here, but it also applies to
the list of figures and list of tables.

   This will put some vertical space in the table of contents after the
‘Contents’ header.

     \tableofcontents\newpage
     \addtocontents{toc}{\protect\vspace*{3ex}}

This puts the word ‘Page’, in boldface, above the column of page numbers
and after the header.

     \tableofcontents
     \addtocontents{toc}{~\hfill\textbf{Page}\par}
     \chapter{...}

This adds a line announcing work by a new author.

     \addtocontents{toc}{%
       \protect\vspace{2ex}
       \textbf{Chapters by N. Other Author}\par}

   The difference between ‘\addtocontents’ and ‘\addcontentsline’ is
that the latter is strictly for lines, such as with a line giving the
page number for the start of a new subset of the chapters.  As the above
examples show, ‘\addtocontents’ is for material such as spacing.

   The ‘\addtocontents’ command has two arguments.  Both are required.

EXT
     Typically one of: ‘toc’ for the table of contents, ‘lof’ for the
     list of figures, or ‘lot’ for the list of tables.  The extension of
     the file holding the information.

TEXT
     The text, and possibly commands, to be written.

   The sectioning commands such as ‘\chapter’ use the ‘\addcontentsline’
command to store information.  This command creates lines in the ‘.toc’
auxiliary file containing the ‘\contentsline’ command (*note
\addcontentsline::).  In contrast, the command ‘\addtocontents’ puts
material directly in that file.

   The ‘\addtocontents’ command has an interaction with ‘\include’
(*note \include & \includeonly::).  If you use them at the same level,
as with ‘\addtocontents{...}{...}\include{...}’ then lines in the table
of contents can come out in the wrong order.  The solution is to move
‘\addtocontents’ into the file being included.

25.1.4 ‘\contentsline’
----------------------

Synopsis:

     \contentsline{UNIT}{TEXT}{PAGENUMBER}

   Used internally by LaTeX to typeset an entry of the table of
contents, list of figures, or list of tables (*note Table of contents
etc.::).  Authors do not directly enter ‘\contentsline’ commands.

   Usually adding material to these lists is done automatically by the
commands ‘\chapter’, ‘\section’, etc.  for the table of contents, or by
the ‘\caption’ command inside of a ‘\figure’ or ‘\table’ environment
(*note figure:: and *note table::).  Thus, where the root file is
‘thesis.tex’, and contains the declaration ‘\tableofcontents’, the
command ‘\chapter{Chapter One}’ produces something like this in the file
‘thesis.toc’.

     \contentsline {chapter}{\numberline {1}Chapter One}{3}

   If the file contains the declaration ‘\listoffigures’ then a figure
environment involving ‘\caption{Test}’ will produce something like this
in ‘thesis.lof’.

     \contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Test}}{6}

   To manually add material, use
‘\addcontentsline{FILETYPE}{UNIT}{TEXT}’, where FILETYPE is ‘toc’,
‘lof’, or ‘lot’ (*note \addcontentsline::).

   For manipulating how the ‘\contentline’ material is typeset, see the
‘tocloft’ package.

   Note that the ‘hyperref’ package changes the definition of
‘\contentsline’ (and ‘\addcontentsline’) to add more arguments, to make
hyperlinks.  This is the source of the error ‘Argument of \contentsline
has an extra }’ when one adds/remove the use of package ‘hyperref’ and a
compilation was already run.  Fix this error by deleting the ‘.toc’ or
‘.lof’ or ‘.lot’ file, and running LaTeX again.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \nofiles,  Next: \numberline,  Prev: \contentsline,  Up: Table of contents etc.

25.1.5 ‘\nofiles’
-----------------

Synopsis:

     \nofiles

   Prevent LaTeX from writing any auxiliary files.  The only output will
be the ‘.log’ and ‘.pdf’ (or ‘.dvi’) files.  This command must go in the
preamble.

   Because of the ‘\nofiles’ command this example will not produce a
‘.toc’ file.

     \documentclass{book}
     \nofiles
     \begin{document}
     \tableofcontents\newpage
     \chapter{...}
       ...

LaTeX will not erase any existing auxiliary files, so if you insert the
‘\nofiles’ command after you have run the file and gotten a ‘.toc’ then
the table of contents page will continue to show the old information.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \numberline,  Prev: \nofiles,  Up: Table of contents etc.

25.1.6 ‘\numberline’
--------------------

Synopsis:

     \numberline{NUMBER}

   Typeset its argument flush left in a box.  This is used in a
‘\contentsline’ command to typeset the section number (*note
\contentsline::).

   For example, this line in a ‘.toc’ file causes the ‘1.1’ to be
typeset flush left.

     \contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {1.1}Motivation}{2}

   By default, LaTeX typesets the section numbers in a box of length
‘\@tempdima’.  That length is set by the commands ‘\l@section’,
‘\l@subsection’, etc.  Put section numbers inside a natural-width box
with ‘\renewcommand{\numberline}[1]{#1~}’ before ‘\tableofcontents’.

   This command is fragile so you may need to precede it with ‘\protect’
(*note \protect::).  An example is the use of ‘\protect’ in this
command,

     \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Summary}

to get the ‘\numberline’ into the ‘\contentsline’ command in the ‘.toc’
file: ‘\contentsline {section}{\numberline {}Summary}{6}’ (the page
number ‘6’ is automatically added by LaTeX; *note \addcontentsline::).

25.2 Indexes
============

If you tell LaTeX what terms you want to appear in an index then it can
produce that index, alphabetized and with the page numbers automatically
maintained.  This illustrates the basics.

     \documentclass{article}
     \usepackage{makeidx}  % Provide indexing commands
       \makeindex
     % \usepackage{showidx}  % Show marginal notes of index entries
       ...
     \begin{document}
       ...
     Wilson's Theorem\index{Wilson's Theorem}
     says that a number $n>1$ is prime if and only if the factorial
     of $n-1$ is congruent to $-1$
     modulo~$n$.\index{congruence!and Wilson's Theorem}
       ...
     \printindex
     \end{document}

As that shows, declare index entries with the ‘\index’ command (*note
\index::).  When you run LaTeX, the ‘\index’ writes its information,
such as ‘Wilson's Theorem’ and the page number, to an auxiliary file
whose name ends in ‘.idx’.  Next, to alphabetize and do other
manipulations, run an external command, typically ‘makeindex’ (*note
makeindex::), which writes a file whose name ends in ‘.ind’.  Finally,
‘\printindex’ brings this manipulated information into the output (*note
\printindex::).

   Thus, if the above example is in the file ‘numth.tex’ then running
‘pdflatex numth’ will save index entry and page number information to
‘numth.idx’.  Then running ‘makeindex numth’ will alphabetize and save
the results to ‘numth.ind’.  Finally, again running ‘pdflatex numth’
will show the desired index, at the place where the ‘\printindex’
command is in the source file.

   There are many options for the output.  An example is that the
exclamation point in ‘\index{congruence!and Wilson's Theorem}’ produces
a main entry of ‘congruence’ with a subentry of ‘and Wilson's Theorem’.
For more, *note makeindex::.

   The ‘\makeindex’ and ‘\printindex’ commands are independent.  Leaving
out the ‘\makeindex’ will stop LaTeX from saving the index entries to
the auxiliary file.  Leaving out the ‘\printindex’ will cause LaTeX to
not show the index in the document output.

   There are many packages in the area of indexing.  The ‘showidx’
package causes each index entries to be shown in the margin on the page
where the ‘\index’ appears.  This can help in preparing the index.  The
‘multind’ package, among others, supports multiple indexes.  See also
the TeX FAQ entry on this topic, <https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-multind>,
and the CTAN topic, <https://ctan.org/topic/index-multi>.

* Menu:

* Produce the index manually::   Alphabetize entries yourself.
* \index::        Declare an index entry.
* makeindex::     Alphabetize index entries automatically.
* \printindex::   Put the index here.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Produce the index manually,  Next: \index,  Up: Indexes

25.2.1 Produce the index manually
---------------------------------

Documents that are small and static can have a manually produced index.
This will make a separate page labeled ‘Index’, in twocolumn format.

     \begin{theindex}
     \item acorn squash, 1
     \subitem maple baked, 2
     \indexspace
     \item bacon, 3
     \subitem maple baked, 4
     \end{theindex}

   Note that the author must enter the page numbers, which is tedious
and which will result in wrong numbers if the document changes.  This is
why in most cases automated methods such as ‘makeindex’ are best.  *Note
Indexes::.

   However we cover the commands for completeness, and because the
automated methods are based on these commands.  There are three levels
of entries.  As the example shows, a main entry uses ‘\item’, subentries
use ‘\subitem’, and the lowest level uses ‘\subsubitem’.  Blank lines
between entries have no effect.  The example above includes
‘\indexspace’ to produce vertical space in the output that some index
styles use before the first entry starting with a new letter.

25.2.2 ‘\index’
---------------

Synopsis:

     \index{INDEX-ENTRY-STRING}

   Declare an entry in the index.  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).

   For example, as described in *note Indexes::, one way to get an index
from what's below is to compile the document with ‘pdflatex test’, then
process the index entries with ‘makeindex test’, and then compile again
with ‘pdflatex test’.

     % file test.tex
       ...
     W~Ackermann (1896--1962).\index{Ackermann}
       ...
     Ackermann function\index{Ackermann!function}
       ...
     rate of growth\index{Ackermann!function!growth rate}

All three index entries will get a page number, such as ‘Ackermann, 22’.
LaTeX will format the second as a subitem of the first, on the line
below it and indented, and the third as a subitem of the second.  Three
levels deep is as far as you can nest subentries.  (If you add
‘\index{Ackermann!function!growth rate!comparison}’ then ‘makeindex’
says ‘Scanning input file test.idx....done (4 entries accepted, 1
rejected)’ and the fourth level is silently missing from the index.)

   If you enter a second ‘\index’ with the same INDEX-ENTRY-STRING then
you will get a single index entry with two page numbers (unless they
happen to fall on the same page).  Thus, adding ‘as for
Ackermann.\index{Ackermann}’ later in the same document as above will
give an index entry like ‘Ackermann, 22, 151’.  Also, you can enter the
index entries in any order, so for instance ‘\index{Ackermann!function}’
could come before ‘\index{Ackermann}’.

   Get a page range in the output, like ‘Hilbert, 23--27’, as here.

     W~Ackermann (1896--1962).\index{Ackermann}
       ...
     D~Hilbert (1862--1943)\index{Ackermann!Hilbert|(}
       ...
     disapproved of his marriage.\index{Ackermann!Hilbert|)}

If the beginning and ending of the page range are equal then the system
just gives a single page number, not a range.

   If you index subentries but not a main entry, as with
‘\index{Jones!program}’ and ‘\index{Jones!results}’, then the output is
the item ‘Jones’ with no comma or page number, followed by two subitems,
like ‘program, 50’ and ‘results, 51’.

   Generate a index entry that says ‘see’ by using a vertical bar
character: ‘\index{Ackermann!function|see{P\'eter's function}}’.  You
can instead get ‘see also’ with ‘seealso’.  (The text ‘see’ is defined
by ‘\seename’, and ‘see also’ by ‘\alsoname’.  You can redefine these
either by using an internationalization package such as ‘babel’ or
‘polyglossia’, or directly as with ‘\renewcommand{\alsoname}{Also
see}’.)

   The ‘see’ feature is part of a more general functionality.  After the
vertical bar you can put the name of a one-input command, as in
‘\index{group|textit}’ (note the missing backslash on the ‘\textit’
command) and the system will apply that command to the page number, here
giving something like ‘\textit{7}’.  You can define your own one-input
commands, such as ‘\newcommand{\definedpage}[1]{{\color{blue}#1}}’ and
then ‘\index{Ackermann!function|definedpage}’ will give a blue page
number (*note Color::).  Another, less practical, example is this,

     \newcommand\indexownpage[1]{#1, \thepage}
       ... Epimenides.\index{self-reference|indexownpage}

which creates an entry citing the page number of its own index listing.

   The two functions just described combine, as here

     \index{Ackermann!function|(definedpage}
       ...
     \index{Ackermann!function|)}

which outputs an index entry like ‘function, 23--27’ where the page
number range is in blue.

   Consider an index entry such as ‘α-ring’.  Entering it as
‘$\alpha$-ring’ will cause it to be alphabetized according to the dollar
sign.  You can instead enter it using an at-sign, as
‘\index{alpha-ring@$\alpha$-ring}’.  If you specify an entry with an
at-sign separating two strings, ‘POS@TEXT’, then POS gives the
alphabetical position of the entry while TEXT produces the text of the
entry.  Another example is that ‘\index{Saint Michael's College@SMC}’
produces an index entry ‘SMC’ alphabetized into a different location
than its spelling would naturally give it.

   To put a ‘!’, or ‘@’, or ‘|’, or ‘"’ character in an index entry,
escape it by preceding it with a double quote, ‘"’.  (The double quote
gets deleted before alphabetization.)

   A number of packages on CTAN have additional functionality beyond
that provided by ‘makeidx’.  One is ‘index’, which allows for multiple
indices and contains a command ‘\index*{INDEX-ENTRY-STRING}’ that prints
the INDEX-ENTRY-STRING as well as indexing it.

   The ‘\index’ command writes the indexing information to the file
‘ROOT-NAME.idx’ file.  Specifically, it writes text of the command
‘\indexentry{INDEX-ENTRY-STRING}{PAGE-NUM}’, where PAGE-NUM is the value
of the ‘\thepage’ counter.  On occasion, when the ‘\printindex’ command
is confused, you have to delete this file to start with a fresh slate.

   If you omit the closing brace of an ‘\index’ command then you get a
message like this.

     Runaway argument?  {Ackermann!function
     !  Paragraph ended before \@wrindex was complete.

25.2.3 ‘makeindex’
------------------

Synopsis, one of:

     makeindex FILENAME
     makeindex -s STYLE-FILE FILENAME
     makeindex OPTIONS FILENAME0 ...

   Sort, and otherwise process, the index information in the auxiliary
file FILENAME.  This is a command line program.  It takes one or more
raw index files, ‘FILENAME.idx’ files, and produces the actual index
file, the ‘FILENAME.ind’ file that is input by ‘\printindex’ (*note
\printindex::).

   The first form of the command suffices for many uses.  The second
allows you to format the index by using an “index style file”, a ‘.isty’
file.  The third form is the most general; see the full documentation on
CTAN.

   This is a simple ‘.isty’ file.

     % book.isty
     %   $ makeindex -s book.isty -p odd book.idx
     % creates the index as book.ind, starting on an odd page.
     preamble
     "\\pagestyle{empty}
     \\small
     \\begin{theindex}
     \\thispagestyle{empty}"

     postamble
     "\n
     \\end{theindex}"

   The description here covers only some of the index formatting
possibilities in STYLE-FILE.  For a full list see the documentation on
CTAN.

   A style file consists of a list of pairs: SPECIFIER and ATTRIBUTE.
These can appear in the file in any order.  All of the ATTRIBUTEs are
strings, except where noted.  Strings are surrounded with double quotes,
‘"’, and the maximum length of a string is 144 characters.  The ‘\n’ is
for a newline and ‘\t’ is for a tab.  Backslashes are escaped with
another backslash, ‘\\’.  If a line begins with a percent sign, ‘%’,
then it is a comment.

‘preamble’
     Preamble of the output index file.  Defines the context in which
     the index is formatted.  Default: ‘"\\begin{theindex}\n"’.

‘postamble’
     Postamble of the output index file.  Default:
     ‘"\n\n\\end{theindex}\n"’.

‘group_skip’
     Traditionally index items are broken into groups, typically a group
     for entries starting with letter ‘a’, etc.  This specifier gives
     what is inserted when a new group begins.  Default: ‘"\n\n
     \\indexspace\n"’ (‘\indexspace’ is a command inserting a rubber
     length, by default ‘10pt plus5pt minus3pt’).

‘lethead_flag’
     An integer.  It governs what is inserted for a new group or letter.
     If it is 0 (which is the default) then other than ‘group_skip’
     nothing will be inserted before the group.  If it is positive then
     at a new letter the ‘lethead_prefix’ and ‘lethead_suffix’ will be
     inserted, with that letter in uppercase between them.  If it is
     negative then what will be inserted is the letter in lowercase.
     The default is 0.

‘lethead_prefix’
     If a new group begins with a different letter then this is the
     prefix inserted before the new letter header.  Default: ‘""’

‘lethead_suffix’
     If a group begins with a different letter then this is the suffix
     inserted after the new letter header.  Default: ‘""’.

‘item_0’
     What is put between two level 0 items.  Default: ‘"\n \\item "’.

‘item_1’
     Put between two level 1 items.  Default: ‘"\n \\subitem "’.

‘item_2’
     put between two level 2 items.  Default: ‘"\n \\subsubitem "’.

‘item_01’
     What is put between a level 0 item and a level 1 item.  Default:
     ‘"\n \\subitem "’.

‘item_x1’
     What is put between a level 0 item and a level 1 item in the case
     that the level 0 item doesn't have any page numbers (as in
     ‘\index{aaa|see{bbb}}’).  Default: ‘"\n \\subitem "’.

‘item_12’
     What is put between a level 1 item and a level 2 item.  Default:
     ‘"\n \\subsubitem "’.

‘item_x2’
     What is put between a level 1 item and a level 2 item, if the
     level 1 item doesn't have page numbers.  Default: ‘"\n \\subsubitem
     "’.

‘delim_0’
     Delimiter put between a level 0 key and its first page number.
     Default: a comma followed by a blank, ‘", "’.

‘delim_1’
     Delimiter put between a level 1 key and its first page number.
     Default: a comma followed by a blank, ‘", "’.

‘delim_2’
     Delimiter between a level 2 key and its first page number.
     Default: a comma followed by a blank, ‘", "’.

‘delim_n’
     Delimiter between two page numbers for the same key (at any level).
     Default: a comma followed by a blank, ‘", "’.

‘delim_r’
     What is put between the starting and ending page numbers of a
     range.  Default: ‘"--"’.

‘line_max’
     An integer.  Maximum length of an index entry's line in the output,
     beyond which the line wraps.  Default: ‘72’.

‘indent_space’
     What is inserted at the start of a wrapped line.  Default:
     ‘"\t\t"’.

‘indent_length’
     A number.  The length of the wrapped line indentation.  The default
     ‘indent_space’ is two tabs and each tab is eight spaces so the
     default here is ‘16’.

‘page_precedence’
     A document may have pages numbered in different ways.  For example,
     a book may have front matter pages numbered in lowercase roman
     while main matter pages are in arabic.  This string specifies the
     order in which they will appear in the index.  The ‘makeindex’
     command supports five different types of numerals: lowercase roman
     ‘r’, and numeric or arabic ‘n’, and lowercase alphabetic ‘a’, and
     uppercase roman ‘R’, and uppercase alphabetic ‘A’.  Default:
     ‘"rnaRA"’.

   There are a number of other programs that do the job ‘makeindex’
does.  One is ‘xindy’ (<https://ctan.org/pkg/xindy>), which does
internationalization and can process indexes for documents marked up
using LaTeX and a number of other languages.  It is written in Lisp,
highly configurable, both in markup terms and in terms of the collating
order of the text, as described in its documentation.

   A more recent indexing program supporting Unicode is ‘xindex’,
written in Lua (<https://ctan.org/pkg/xindex>).

25.2.4 ‘\printindex’
--------------------

Synopsis:

     \printindex

   Place the index into the output.

   To get an index you must first include
‘\usepackage{makeidx}\makeindex’ in the document preamble and compile
the document, then run the system command ‘makeindex’, and then compile
the document again.  *Note Indexes::, for further discussion and an
example of the use of ‘\printindex’.

25.3 Glossaries
===============

Synopsis:

     \usepackage{glossaries} \makeglossaries
       ...
     \newglossaryentry{LABEL}{SETTINGS}
       ...
     \gls{LABEL}.
       ...
     \printglossaries

   The ‘glossaries’ package allows you to make glossaries, including
multiple glossaries, as well as lists of acronyms.

   To get the output from this example, compile the document (for
instance with ‘pdflatex filename’), then run the command line command
‘makeglossaries filename’, and then compile the document again.

     \documentclass{...}
     \usepackage{glossaries} \makeglossaries
     \newglossaryentry{tm}{%
       name={Turing machine},
       description={A model of a machine that computes.  The model is simple
                    but can compute anything any existing device can compute.
                    It is the standard model used in Computer Science.},
       }
     \begin{document}
     Everything begins with the definition of a \gls{tm}.
       ...
     \printglossaries
     \end{document}

That gives two things.  In the main text it outputs ‘... definition of a
Turing machine’.  In addition, in a separate sectional unit headed
‘Glossary’ there appears a description list.  In boldface it says
‘Turing machine’ and the rest of the item says in normal type ‘A model
of a machine ... Computer Science’.

   The command ‘\makeglossary’ opens the file that will contain the
entry information, ‘ROOT-FILE.glo’.  Put the ‘\printglossaries’ command
where you want the glossaries to appear in your document.

   The ‘glossaries’ package is very powerful.  For instance, besides the
commands ‘\newglossaryentry’ and ‘\gls’, there are similar commands for
a list of acronyms.  See the package documentations on CTAN.

* Menu:

* \newglossaryentry::  Declare the content of a glossary entry.
* \gls::               Give a page reference for a glossary entry.

25.3.1 ‘\newglossaryentry’
--------------------------

Synopsis, one of:

     \newglossaryentry{LABEL}
     {
       name={NAME},
       description={DESCRIPTION},
       OTHER OPTIONS, ...
     }

   or

     \longnewglossaryentry{LABEL}
     {
       name={NAME},
       OTHER OPTIONS ...,
     }
     {DESCRIPTION}

   Declare a new entry for a glossary.  The LABEL must be unique for the
document.  The settings associated with the label are pairs:
‘KEY=VALUE’.

   This puts the blackboard bold symbol for the real numbers ℝ, in the
glossary.

     \newglossaryentry{R}
     {
       name={\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}},
       description={the real numbers},
     }

   Use the second command form if the DESCRIPTION spans more than one
paragraph.

   For a full list of KEYs see the package documentation on CTAN but
here are a few.

‘name’
     (Required.)  The word, phrase, or symbol that you are defining.

‘description’
     (Required.)  The description that will appear in the glossary.  If
     this has more than one paragraph then you must use the second
     command form given in the synopsis.

‘plural’
     The plural form of NAME.  Refer to the plural form using ‘\glspl’
     or ‘\Glspl’ (*note \gls::).

‘sort’
     How to place this entry in the list of entries that the glossary
     holds.

‘symbol’
     A symbol, such as a mathematical symbol, besides the name.

Synopsis, one of:

     \gls{LABEL}
     \glspl{LABEL}
     \Gls{LABEL}

   Refer to a glossary entry.  The entries are declared with
‘\newglossaryentry’ (*note \newglossaryentry::).

   This

     \newglossaryentry{N}{%

       description={The numbers $0$, $1$, $2$, $\ldots$\@},
       symbol={\ensuremath{\mathbb{N}}},
       }
       ...
     Consider \gls{N}.

gives the output ‘Consider the natural numbers’.

   The second command form ‘\glspl{LABEL}’ produces the plural of NAME
(by default it tries adding an ‘s’).  The third form capitalizes the
first letter of NAME, as does the fourth form, which also takes the
plural.

26 Letters
**********

Synopsis:

     \documentclass{letter}
     \address{SENDERS ADDRESS}   % return address
     \signature{SENDER NAME}
     \begin{document}
     \begin{letter}{RECIPIENT ADDRESS}
     \opening{SALUTATION}
       LETTER BODY
     \closing{CLOSING TEXT}
     \end{letter}
        ...
     \end{document}

   Produce one or more letters.

   Each letter is in a separate ‘letter’ environment, whose argument
RECIPIENT ADDRESS often contains multiple lines separated with a double
backslash, (‘\\’).  For example, you might have:

      \begin{letter}{Ninon de l'Enclos \\
                     l'h\^otel Sagonne}
        ...
      \end{letter}

   The start of the ‘letter’ environment resets the page number to 1,
and the footnote number to 1 also.

   The SENDER ADDRESS and SENDER NAME are common to all of the letters,
whether there is one or more, so these are best put in the preamble.  As
with the recipient address, often SENDER ADDRESS contains multiple lines
separated by a double backslash (‘\\’).  LaTeX will put the SENDER NAME
under the closing, after a vertical space for the traditional
hand-written signature.

   Each ‘letter’ environment body begins with a required ‘\opening’
command such as ‘\opening{Dear Madam or Sir:}’.  The LETTER BODY text is
ordinary LaTeX so it can contain everything from enumerated lists to
displayed math, except that commands such as ‘\chapter’ that make no
sense in a letter are turned off.  Each ‘letter’ environment body
typically ends with a ‘\closing’ command such as ‘\closing{Yours,}’.

   Additional material may come after the ‘\closing’.  You can say who
is receiving a copy of the letter with a command like ‘\cc{the Boss \\
the Boss's Boss}’.  There's a similar ‘\encl’ command for a list of
enclosures.  And, you can add a postscript with ‘\ps’.

   LaTeX's default is to indent the sender name and the closing above it
by a length of ‘\longindentation’.  By default this is ‘0.5\textwidth’.
To make them flush left, put ‘\setlength{\longindentation}{0em}’ in your
preamble.

   To set a fixed date use something like
‘\renewcommand{\today}{1958-Oct-12}’.  If put in your preamble then it
will apply to all the letters.

   This example shows only one ‘letter’ environment.  The three lines
marked as optional are typically omitted.

     \documentclass{letter}
     \address{Sender's street \\ Sender's town}
     \signature{Sender's name \\ Sender's title}
     % optional: \location{Mailbox 13}
     % optional: \telephone{(102) 555-0101}
     \begin{document}
     \begin{letter}{Recipient's name \\ Recipient's address}
     \opening{Sir:}
     % optional: \thispagestyle{firstpage}
     I am not interested in entering a business arrangement with you.
     \closing{Your most humble, etc.,}
     \end{letter}
     \end{document}

   These commands are used with the ‘letter’ class.

* Menu:

* \address::                       Sender's return address.
* \cc::                            Carbon copy list.
* \closing::                       Saying goodbye.
* \encl::                          List of enclosed material.
* \location::                      Sender's organizational location.
* \makelabels::                    Make address labels.

* \opening::                       Saying hello.
* \ps::                            Adding a postscript.
* \signature::                     Sender's signature.

26.1 ‘\address’
===============

Synopsis:

     \address{SENDERS ADDRESS}

   Specify the return address, as it appears on the letter and on the
envelope.  Separate multiple lines in SENDERS ADDRESS with a double
backslash, ‘\\’.

   Because it can apply to multiple letters this declaration is often
put in the preamble.  However, it can go anywhere, including inside an
individual ‘letter’ environment.

   This command is optional: if you do not use it then the letter is
formatted with some blank space on top, for copying onto pre-printed
letterhead paper.  If you do use the ‘\address’ declaration then it is
formatted as a personal letter.

   Here is an example.

     \address{Stephen Maturin \\
              The Grapes of the Savoy}

26.2 ‘\cc’
==========

Synopsis:

     \cc{NAME0 \\
          ... }

   Produce a list of names to which copies of the letter were sent.
This command is optional.  If it appears then typically it comes after
‘\closing’.  Put the names on different lines by separating them with a
double backslash, ‘\\’, as in:

     \cc{President \\
         Vice President}

26.3 ‘\closing’
===============

Synopsis:

     \closing{TEXT}

   Produce the letter's closing.  This is optional, but usual.  It
appears at the end of a letter, above a handwritten signature.  For
example:

     \closing{Regards,}

26.4 ‘\encl’
============

Synopsis:

     \encl{FIRST ENCLOSED OBJECT \\
            ... }

   Produce a list of things included with the letter.  This command is
optional; when it is used, it typically is put after ‘\closing’.
Separate multiple lines with a double backslash, ‘\\’.

     \encl{License \\
           Passport}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \location,  Next: \makelabels,  Prev: \encl,  Up: Letters

26.5 ‘\location’
================

Synopsis:

     \location{TEXT}

   The TEXT appears centered at the bottom of the page.  It only appears
if the page style is ‘firstpage’.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \makelabels,  Next: \name,  Prev: \location,  Up: Letters

26.6 ‘\makelabels’
==================

Synopsis:

     \makelabels   % in preamble

   Optional, for a document that contains ‘letter’ environments.  If you
just put ‘\makelabels’ in the preamble then at the end of the document
you will get a sheet with labels for all the recipients, one for each
letter environment, that you can copy to a sheet of peel-off address
labels.

   Customize the labels by redefining the commands ‘\startlabels’,
‘\mlabel’, and ‘\returnaddress’ (and perhaps ‘\name’) in the preamble.
The command ‘\startlabels’ sets the width, height, number of columns,
etc., of the page onto which the labels are printed.  The command
‘\mlabel{RETURN ADDRESS}{RECIPIENT ADDRESS}’ produces the two labels (or
one, if you choose to ignore the RETURN ADDRESS) for each letter
environment.  The first argument, RETURN ADDRESS, is the value returned
by the macro ‘\returnaddress’.  The second argument, RECIPIENT ADDRESS,
is the value passed in the argument to the ‘letter’ environment.  By
default ‘\mlabel’ ignores the first argument, the RETURN ADDRESS,
causing the default behavior described in the prior paragraph.

   This illustrates customization.  Its output includes a page with two
columns having two labels each.

     \documentclass{letter}
     \renewcommand*{\returnaddress}{Fred McGuilicuddy \\
                                    Oshkosh, Mineola 12305}
     \newcommand*\originalMlabel{}
     \let\originalMlabel\mlabel
     \def\mlabel#1#2{\originalMlabel{}{#1}\originalMlabel{}{#2}}
     \makelabels
       ...
     \begin{document}
     \begin{letter}{A Einstein \\
                    112 Mercer Street \\
                    Princeton, New Jersey, USA 08540}
       ...
     \end{letter}
     \begin{letter}{K G\"odel \\
                    145 Linden Lane \\
                    Princeton, New Jersey, USA 08540}
       ...
     \end{letter}
     \end{document}

The first column contains the return address twice.  The second column
contains the address for each recipient.

   The package ‘envlab’ makes formatting the labels easier, with
standard sizes already provided.  The preamble lines
‘\usepackage[personalenvelope]{envlab}’ and ‘\makelabels’ are all that
you need to print envelopes.

26.8 ‘\opening’
===============

Synopsis:

     \opening{SALUTATION}

   Required.  Follows the ‘\begin{letter}{...}’.  The argument
SALUTATION is mandatory.  For instance:

     \opening{Dear John:}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \ps,  Next: \signature,  Prev: \opening,  Up: Letters

26.9 ‘\ps’
==========

Synopsis:

     \ps{TEXT}

   Add a postscript.  This command is optional and usually is used after
‘\closing’.

     \ps{P.S. After you have read this letter, burn it. Or eat it.}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \signature,  Next: \telephone,  Prev: \ps,  Up: Letters

26.10 ‘\signature’
==================

Synopsis:

     \signature{FIRST LINE \\
                 ... }

   The sender's name.  This command is optional, although its inclusion
is usual.

   The argument text appears at the end of the letter, after the
closing.  LaTeX leaves some vertical space for a handwritten signature.
Separate multiple lines with a double backslash, ‘\\’.  For example:

     \signature{J Fred Muggs \\
                White House}

   LaTeX's default for the vertical space from the ‘\closing’ text down
to the ‘\signature’ text is ‘6\medskipamount’, which is six times
‘\medskipamount’ (where ‘\medskipamount’ is equal to a ‘\parskip’, which
in turn is defined by default here to 0.7em).

   This command is usually in the preamble, to apply to all the letters
in the document.  To have it apply to one letter only, put it inside a
‘letter’ environment and before the ‘\closing’.

   You can include a graphic in the signature as here.

     \signature{\vspace{-6\medskipamount}\includegraphics{sig.png}\\
                  My name}

For this you must put ‘\usepackage{graphicx}’ in the preamble (*note
Graphics::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \telephone,  Prev: \signature,  Up: Letters

26.11 ‘\telephone’
==================

Synopsis:

     \telephone{NUMBER}

   The sender's telephone number.  This is typically in the preamble,
where it applies to all letters.  This only appears if the ‘firstpage’
pagestyle is selected.  If so, it appears on the lower right of the
page.

27 Input/output
***************

LaTeX uses the ability to write to a file and later read it back in to
build document components such as a table of contents or index.  You can
also read a file that other programs written, or write a file for others
to read.  You can communicate with users through the terminal.  And, you
can issue instructions for the operating system.

* Menu:

* \openin & \openout::  Open a file.
* \read::               Read text from a file.
* \typein::             Read text from the terminal.
* \typeout::            Write text to the terminal.
* \write::              Write text to a file or terminal.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \openin & \openout,  Next: \read,  Up: Input/output

27.1 ‘\openin’ & ‘\openout’
===========================

Synopsis:

     \openin NUMBER=FILENAME

   or:

     \openout NUMBER=FILENAME

   Open a file for reading material, or for writing it.  In most
engines, the NUMBER must be between 0 and 15, as in ‘\openin3’; in
LuaLaTeX, NUMBER can be between 0 and 127.

   Here TeX opens the file ‘presidents.tex’ for reading.

     \newread\presidentsfile
     \openin\presidentsfile=presidents
     \typeout{presidentsfile is \the\presidentsfile}
     \read\presidentsfile to\presidentline
     \typeout{\presidentline}

The ‘\newread’ command allocates input stream numbers from 0 to 15
(there is also a ‘\newwrite’).  The ‘\presidentsfile’ is more memorable
but under the hood it is still a number; the first ‘\typeout’ gives
something like ‘presidentsfile is 1’.  In addition, ‘\newread’ keeps
track of the allocation so that if you use too many then you get an
error like ‘! No room for a new \read’.  The second ‘\typeout’ gives the
first line of the file, something like ‘1 Washington, George’.

   Ordinarily TeX will not try to open the file until the next page
shipout.  To change this, use ‘\immediate\openin NUMBER=FILENAME’ or
‘\immediate\openout NUMBER=FILENAME’.

   Close files with ‘\closein NUMBER’ and ‘\closeout NUMBER’.

   How LaTeX handles filenames varies among distributions, and even can
vary among versions of a distribution.  If the file does not have an
extension then TeX will add a ‘.tex’.  This creates ‘presidents.tex’,
writes one line to it, and closes it.

     \newwrite\presidentsfile
     \openout\presidentsfile=presidents
     \write\presidentsfile{1 Washington, George}
     \closeout\presidentsfile

But filenames with a period can cause trouble: if TeX finds a FILENAME
of ‘presidents.dat’ it could look first for ‘presidents.dat.tex’ and
later for ‘presidents.dat’, or it could do the opposite.  Your
distribution's documentation should say more, and if you find something
that works for you then you are good, but to ensure complete portability
the best thing is to use file names containing only the twenty six ASCII
letters (not case-sensitive) and the ten digits, along with underscore
and dash, and in particular with no dot or space.

   For ‘\openin’, if TeX cannot find the file then it does not give an
error.  It just considers that the stream is not open (test for this
with ‘\ifeof’; one recourse is the command ‘\InputIfFileExists’, *note
Class and package commands::).  If you try to use the same number twice,
LaTeX won't give you an error.  If you try to use a bad number then you
get an error message like ‘! Bad number (16). <to be read again> = l.30
\openin16=test.jh’.

27.2 ‘\read’
============

Synopsis:

     \read NUMBER toMACRO

   Make the command MACRO contain the next line of input from text
stream NUMBER, as in ‘\read5 to\data’.

   This opens the file ‘email.tex’ for reading, puts the contents of the
first line into the command ‘\email’, and then closes the file.

     \newread\recipientfile
     \openin\recipientfile=email
     \read\recipientfile to\email
     \typeout{Email address: \email}
     \closein\recipientfile

   If NUMBER is outside the range from 0 to 15 or if no file of that
number is open, or if the file has ended, then ‘\read’ will take input
from the terminal (or exit if interaction is not allowed, e.g.,
‘\nonstopmode’; *note interaction modes::).  (However, the natural way
in LaTeX to take input from the terminal is ‘\typein’ (*note \typein::.)

   To read an entire file as additional LaTeX source, use ‘\input’
(*note \input::) or ‘\include’ (*note \include & \includeonly::).

   A common reason to want to read from a data file is to do mail
merges.  CTAN has a number of packages for that; one is ‘datatool’.

27.3 ‘\typein’
==============

Synopsis, one of:

     \typein{PROMPT-MSG}
     \typein[CMD]{PROMPT-MSG}

   Print PROMPT-MSG on the terminal and cause LaTeX to stop and wait for
you to type a line of input.  This line of input ends when you hit the
return key.

   For example, this

     As long as I live I shall never forget \typein{Enter student name:}

coupled with this command line interaction

     Enter student name:

     \@typein=Aphra Behn

gives the output ‘... never forget Aphra Behn’.

   The first command version, ‘\typein{PROMPT-MSG}’, causes the input
you typed to be processed as if it had been included in the input file
in place of the ‘\typein’ command.

   In the second command version the optional argument ‘CMD’ argument
must be a command name, that is, it must begin with a backslash, \.
This command name is then defined or redefined to be the input that you
typed.  For example, this

     \typein[\student]{Enter student name:}
     \typeout{Recommendation for \student .}

gives this output on the command line,

     Enter student name:

     \student=John Dee
     Recommendation for John Dee.

where the user has entered ‘John Dee.’

27.4 ‘\typeout’
===============

Synopsis:

     \typeout{MSG}

   Print ‘msg’ on the terminal and in the ‘log’ file.

   This

     \newcommand{\student}{John Dee}
     \typeout{Recommendation for \student .}

outputs ‘Recommendation for John Dee’.  Like what happens here with
‘\student’, commands that are defined with ‘\newcommand’ or
‘\renewcommand’ (among others) are replaced by their definitions before
being printed.

   LaTeX's usual rules for treating multiple spaces as a single space
and ignoring spaces after a command name apply to ‘msg’.  Use the
command ‘\space’ to get a single space, independent of surrounding
spaces.  Use ‘^^J’ to get a newline.  Get a percent character with
‘\csname @percentchar\endcsname’.

   This command can be useful for simple debugging, as here:

     \newlength{\jhlength}
     \setlength{\jhlength}{5pt}
     \typeout{The length is \the\jhlength.}

produces on the command line ‘The length is 5.0pt’.

27.5 ‘\write’
=============

Synopsis:

     \write NUMBER{STRING}

   Write STRING to the log file, to the terminal, or to a file opened by
‘\openout’.  For instance, ‘\write6’ writes to text stream number 6.

   If the following appears in ‘BASEFILE.tex’ then it opens
‘BASEFILE.jh’, writes ‘Hello World!’ and a newline to it, and closes
that file.

     \newwrite\myfile
     \immediate\openout\myfile=\jobname.jh  % \jobname is root file basename
     ...
     \immediate\write\myfile{Hello world!}
     ...
     \immediate\closeout\myfile

The ‘\newwrite’ allocates a stream number, giving it a symbolic name to
make life easier, so that ‘stream \newwrite\myfile\the\myfile’ produces
something like ‘stream 3’.  Then ‘\openout’ associates the stream number
with the given file name.  TeX ultimately executed ‘\write3’ which puts
the string in the file.

   Typically NUMBER is between 0 and 15, because typically LaTeX authors
follow the prior example and the number is allocated by the system.  If
NUMBER is outside the range from 0 to 15 or if it is not associated with
an open file then LaTeX writes STRING to the log file.  If NUMBER is
positive then in addition LaTeX writes STRING to the terminal.

   Thus, ‘test \write-1{Hello World!}’ puts ‘Hello World!’ followed by a
newline in the log file.  (This is what the ‘\wlog’ command does; *note
\wlog::).  And ‘\write100{Hello World!}’ puts the same in the log file
but also puts ‘Hello World!’ followed by a newline in the terminal
output.  (But 16, 17, and 18 are special as NUMBER; see below.)

   In LuaTeX, instead of 16 output streams there are 256 (*note TeX
engines::).

   Use ‘\write\@auxout{STRING}’ to write to the current ‘.aux’ file,
which is associated with either the root file or with the current
include file; and use ‘\write\@mainaux{STRING}’ to write to the main
‘.aux’.  These symbolic names are defined by LaTeX.

   By default LaTeX does not write STRING to the file right away.  This
is because, for example, you may need ‘\write’ to save the current page
number, but when TeX comes across a ‘\write’ it typically does not know
what the page number is, since it has not yet done the page breaking.
So, you use ‘\write’ in one of three contexts:

     \immediate\write\@auxout{STRING}      %1
     \write\@auxout{STRING}                %2
     \protected@write\@auxout{}{STRING}    %3

  1. With the first, LaTeX writes STRING to the file immediately.  Any
     macros in STRING are fully expanded (just as in ‘\edef’) so to
     prevent expansion you must use ‘\noexpand’, ‘toks’, etc., except
     that you should use ‘#’ instead of ‘##’).

  2. With the second, STRING is stored on the current list of things (as
     a TeX "whatsit" item) and kept until the page is shipped out and
     likewise the macros are unexpanded until ‘\shipout’.  At
     ‘\shipout’, STRING is fully expanded.

  3. The third, ‘\protected@write’, is like the second except that you
     can use ‘\protect’ to avoid expansion.  The extra first argument
     allows you to locally insert extra definitions to make more macros
     protected or to have some other special definition for the write.

   As a simple example of expansion with ‘\write’, STRING here contains
a control sequence ‘\triplex’ which we've defined to be the text ‘XYZ’:

     \newwrite\jhfile
     \openout\jhfile=test.jh
     \newcommand{\triplex}{XYZ}
     \write\jhfile{test \triplex test}

This results in the file ‘test.jh’ containing the text ‘test XYZtest’
followed by a newline.

   The cases where NUMBER is 16, 17, or 18 are special.  Because of
‘\write’'s behavior when NUMBER is outside the range from 0 to 15
described above, in Plain TeX ‘\write16’ and ‘\write17’ were sometimes
used to write to the log file and the terminal; however, in LaTeX, the
natural way to do that is with ‘\typeout’ (*note \typeout::).  The
‘\write18’ command is even more special; modern TeX systems use it for
giving commands to the operating system (*note \write18::).

   Ordinarily ‘\write’ outputs a single line.  You can include a newline
with ‘^^J’.  Thus, this produces two lines in the log file:

     \wlog{Parallel lines have a lot in common.^^JBut they never meet.}

   A common case where authors need to write their own file is for
answers to exercises, or another situation where you want to write out
verbatim, without expanding the macros.  CTAN has a number of packages
for this; one is ‘answers’.

27.5.1 ‘\write’ and security
----------------------------

The ability to write files raises security issues.  If you compiled a
downloaded LaTeX file and it overwrote your password file then you would
be justifiably troubled.

   Thus, by default TeX systems only allow you to open files for writing
that are in the current directory or output directory, if specified
(*note output directory::), or in a subdirectory of those.  So, this
code

     \newwrite\jhfile
     \openout\jhfile=../test.jh

gives an error like:
     Not writing to ../test.jh (openout_any = p).
     ! I can't write on file `../test.jh'

   You can get just such an error when using commands such as
‘\include{../filename}’ because LaTeX will try to open
‘../filename.aux’.  The simplest solution is to put the included files
in the same directory as the root file, or in subdirectories.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \message,  Next: \wlog,  Prev: \write and security,  Up: \write

27.5.2 ‘\message’
-----------------

Synopsis:

     \message{STRING}

   Write STRING to the log file and the terminal.

   Typically, LaTeX authors use ‘\typeout’ (*note \typeout::).  It
allows you to use ‘\protect’ on any fragile commands in STRING (*note
\protect::).  But ‘\typeout’ always inserts a newline at the end of
STRING while ‘\message’ does not, so the latter can be useful.

   With this example document body.

     before\message{One Two}\message{Three}\message{Four^^JI}
     \message{declare a thumb war.}After

under some circumstances (see below) LaTeX writes the following to both
the terminal and the log file.

     One Two Three Four
     I declare a thumb war.

The ‘^^J’ produces a newline.  Also, in the output document, between
‘before’ and ‘After’ will be a single space (from the end of line
following ‘I}’).

   While ‘\message’ allows you more control over formatting, a gotcha is
that LaTeX may mess up that formatting because it inserts line breaks
depending on what it has already written.  Contrast this document body,
where the ‘Two’ has moved, to the one given above.

     before\message{One}\message{Two Three}\message{Four^^JI}
     \message{declare a thumb war.}After

   This can happen: when LaTeX is outputting the messages to the
terminal, now the message with ‘One’ is shorter and it fits at the end
of the output terminal line, and so LaTeX breaks the line between it and
the ‘Two Three’.  That line break appears also in the log file.  This
line break insertion can depend on, for instance, the length of the full
path names of included files.  So producing finely-formatted lines in a
way that is portable is hard, likely requiring starting your message at
the beginning of a line.

27.5.3 ‘\wlog’
--------------

Synopsis:

     \wlog{STRING}

   Write STRING to the log file.

     \wlog{Did you hear about the mathematician who hates negatives?}
     \wlog{He'll stop at nothing to avoid them.}

   Ordinarily STRING appears in a single separate line.  Use ‘^^J’ to
insert a newline.

     \wlog{Helvetica and Times Roman walk into a bar.}
     \wlog{The barman says,^^JWe don't serve your type.}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \write18,  Prev: \wlog,  Up: \write

27.5.4 ‘\write18’
-----------------

Synopsis:

     \write18{SHELL_COMMAND}

   Issue a command to the operating system shell.  The operating system
runs the command and LaTeX's execution is blocked until that finishes.

   This sequence (on Unix)

     \usepackage{graphicx}  % in preamble
       ...
     \newcommand{\fignum}{1}
     \immediate\write18{cd pix && asy figure\fignum}
     \includegraphics{pix/figure\fignum.pdf}

will run Asymptote (the ‘asy’ program) on ‘pix/figure1.asy’, so that the
document can later read in the resulting graphic (*note
\includegraphics::).  Like any ‘\write’, here LaTeX expands macros in
SHELL_COMMAND so that ‘\fignum’ is replaced by ‘1’.

   Another example is that you can automatically run BibTeX at the start
of each LaTeX run (*note Using BibTeX::) by including
‘\immediate\write18{bibtex8 \jobname}’ as the first line of the file.
Note that ‘\jobname’ expands to the basename of the root file unless the
‘--jobname’ option is passed on the command line, in which case this is
the option argument.

   You sometimes need to do a multi-step process to get the information
that you want.  This will insert into the input a list of all PDF files
in the current directory (but see ‘texosquery’ below):

     \immediate\write18{ls *.pdf > tmp.dat}
     \input{tmp.dat}

   The standard behavior of any ‘\write’ is to wait until a page is
being shipped out before expanding the macros or writing to the stream
(*note \write::).  But sometimes you want it done now.  For this, use
‘\immediate\write18{SHELL_COMMAND}’.

   There are obvious security issues with allowing system commands
inside a LaTeX file.  If you download a file off the net and it contains
commands to delete all your files then you would be unhappy.  The
standard settings in modern distributions turn off full shell access.
You can turn it on, if you are sure the shell commands are safe, by
compiling with ‘latex --enable-write18 FILENAME’ (*note Command line
options::).  (The ‘--shell-escape’ option is a synonym, in TeX Live.)

   In the place of full shell access, modern distributions by default
use a restricted version that allows some commands to work, such as
those that run Metafont to generate missing fonts, even if you do not
use the ‘enable-write18’ option.  By default this list of allowed
commands is short and features only commands that are under the control
of the distribution maintainers (*note Command line options::).

   The SHELL_COMMAND text is always passed to ‘/bin/sh’ on Unix-like
operating systems, and the DOS command interpreter ‘cmd.exe’ on Windows.
Any different shell set by the user, and the ‘SHELL’ environment
variable, is ignored.

   If what you need is system information, such as the operating system
name, locale information, or directory contents, take a look at the
‘texosquery’ package, which provides a convenient and secure interface
for this, unlike the above examples using the raw ‘\write18’:
<https://ctan.org/pkg/texosquery>.

   LaTeX provides a package ‘shellesc’ on top of the primitive
‘\write18’ command.  Its primary purpose is to provide a command
‘\ShellEscape’ which works identically on all TeX engines; LuaTeX
intentionally did not retain ‘\write18’ as a way to invoke a shell
command, so some engine-specific code is needed.  The ‘shellesc’ package
also provides a command ‘\DelayedShellEscape’, executed at ‘\output’
time, for the same reason.

*************************

Synopsis (from a terminal command line):

     pdflatex OPTIONS ARGUMENT

   Run LaTeX on ARGUMENT.  In place of ‘pdflatex’ you can also use (for
PDF output) ‘xelatex’ or ‘lualatex’, or (for DVI output) ‘latex’ or
‘dvilualatex’, among others (*note TeX engines::).

   For example, this will run LaTeX on the file ‘thesis.tex’, creating
the output ‘thesis.pdf’.

     pdflatex thesis

Note that ‘.tex’ is the default file name extension.

   pdfTeX is an extension of the original TeX program, as are XeTeX and
LuaTeX (*note TeX engines::).  The first two are completely backward
compatible and the latter, almost so.  Perhaps the most fundamental new
feature for all three is that the original TeX output its own DVI
format, while the newer ones can output directly to PDF. This allows
them to take advantage of the extra features in PDF such as hyperlinks,
support for modern image formats such as JPG and PNG, and ubiquitous
viewing programs.  In short, if you run ‘pdflatex’ or ‘xelatex’ or
‘lualatex’ then you will by default get PDF and have access to all its
modern features.  If you run ‘latex’, or ‘dvilualatex’, then you will
get DVI. The description here assumes ‘pdflatex’.

   *Note Command line options::, for a selection of the most useful
command line options.  As to ARGUMENT, the usual case is that it does
not begin with a backslash, so the system takes it to be the name of a
file and it compiles that file.  If ARGUMENT begins with a backslash
then the system will interpret it as a line of LaTeX input, which can be
used for special effects (*note Command line input::).

   If you gave no arguments or options then ‘pdflatex’ prompts for input
from the terminal.  You can escape from this by entering ‘CTRL-D’.

   If LaTeX finds an error in your document then by default it stops and
asks you about it.  *Note Recovering from errors::, for an outline of
what to do.

28.1 Command line options
=========================

These are the command-line options relevant to ordinary document
authoring.  For a full list, try running ‘latex --help’ from the command
line.

   With many implementations you can specify command line options by
prefixing them with ‘-’ or ‘--’.  This is the case for both TeX Live
(including MacTeX) and MiKTeX.  We will use both conventions
interchangeably.  If an option takes a value, it can be specified either
as a separate argument (‘--foo val’), or as one argument with an ‘=’
sign (‘--foo=val’), but there can be no spaces around the ‘=’.  We will
generally use the ‘=’ syntax.

‘-version’
     Show the current version, like ‘pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.16 (TeX
     Live 2015/Debian)’ along with a small amount of additional
     information, and exit.

‘-help’
     Give a brief usage message that is useful as a prompt and exit.

‘-interaction=MODE’
     TeX compiles a document in one of four interaction modes:
     ‘batchmode’, ‘nonstopmode’, ‘scrollmode’, ‘errorstopmode’.  In
     “errorstopmode” (the default), TeX stops at each error and asks for
     user intervention.  In “batchmode” it prints nothing on the
     terminal, errors are scrolled as if the user hit ‘RETURN’ at every
     error, and missing files cause the job to abort.  In “nonstopmode”,
     diagnostic message appear on the terminal but as in batch mode
     there is no user interaction.  In “scrollmode”, TeX stops for
     missing files or keyboard input, but nothing else.

     For instance, starting LaTeX with this command line

          pdflatex -interaction=batchmode FILENAME

     eliminates most terminal output.

‘-jobname=STRING’
     Set the value of TeX's “jobname” to the string.  The log file and
     output file will then be named ‘STRING.log’ and ‘STRING.pdf’.
     *note Jobname::.

‘-output-directory=DIRECTORY’
     Write files in the directory DIRECTORY.  It must already exist.
     This applies to all external files created by TeX or LaTeX, such as
     the ‘.log’ file for the run, the ‘.aux’, ‘.toc’, etc., files
     created by LaTeX, as well as the main ‘.pdf’ or ‘.dvi’ output file
     itself.

     When specified, the output directory DIRECTORY is also
     automatically checked first for any file that it is input, so that
     the external files can be read back in, if desired.  The true
     current directory (in which LaTeX was run) remains unchanged, and
     is also checked for input files.

‘--enable-write18’
‘--disable-write18’
‘--shell-escape’
‘--no-shell-escape’
     Enable or disable ‘\write18{SHELL_COMMAND}’ (*note \write18::).
     The first two options are supported by both TeX Live and MiKTeX,
     while the second two are synonyms supported by TeX Live.

     Enabling this functionality has major security implications, since
     it allows a LaTeX file to run any command whatsoever.  Thus, by
     default, unrestricted ‘\write18’ is not allowed.  (The default for
     TeX Live, MacTeX, and MiKTeX is to allow the execution of a limited
     number of TeX-related programs, which they distribute.)

     For example, if you invoke LaTeX with the option ‘no-shell-escape’,
     and in your document you call ‘\write18{ls -l}’, then you do not
     get an error but the log file says ‘runsystem(ls -l)...disabled’.

‘-halt-on-error’
     Stop processing at the first error.

‘-file-line-error’
‘-no-file-line-error’
     Enable or disable ‘FILENAME:LINENO:ERROR’-style error messages.
     These are only available with TeX Live or MacTeX.

28.2 Command line input
=======================

As part of the command line invocation

     LATEX-ENGINE OPTIONS ARGUMENT

you can specify arbitrary LaTeX input by starting ARGUMENT with a
backslash.  (All the engines support this.)  This allows you to do some
special effects.

   For example, this file (which uses the ‘hyperref’ package for
hyperlinks) can produce two kinds of output, one to be read on physical
paper and one to be read online.

     \ifdefined\paperversion        % in preamble
     \newcommand{\urlcolor}{black}
     \else
     \newcommand{\urlcolor}{blue}
     \fi
     \usepackage[colorlinks=true,urlcolor=\urlcolor]{hyperref}
       ...
     \href{https://www.ctan.org}{CTAN}  % in body
       ...

Compiling this document ‘book.tex’ with the command line ‘pdflatex book’
will give the ‘CTAN’ link in blue.  But compiling it with

     pdflatex "\def\paperversion{}\input book.tex"

has the link in black.  We use double quotes to prevent interpretation
of the symbols by the command line shell.  (This usually works on both
Unix and Windows systems, but there are many peculiarities to shell
quoting, so read your system documentation if need be.)

   In a similar way, from the single file ‘main.tex’ you can compile two
different versions.

     pdflatex -jobname=students "\def\student{}\input{main}"
     pdflatex -jobname=teachers "\def\teachers{}\input{main}"

The ‘jobname’ option is there because otherwise both files would be
called ‘main.pdf’ and the second would overwrite the first (*note
Jobname::).

   In this example we use the command line to select which parts of a
document to include.  For a book named ‘mybook.tex’ and structured like
this.

     \documentclass{book}
     \begin{document}
        ...
     \include{chap1}
     \include{chap2}
       ...
     \end{document}

the command line

     pdflatex "\includeonly{chap1}\input{mybook}"

will give output that has the first chapter but no other chapter.  *Note
Splitting the input::.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Jobname,  Next: Recovering from errors,  Prev: Command line input,  Up: Command line interface

28.3 Jobname
============

Running LaTeX creates a number of files, including the main PDF (or DVI)
output but also including others.  These files are named with the
so-called “jobname”.  The most common case is also the simplest, where
for instance the command ‘pdflatex thesis’ creates ‘thesis.pdf’ and also
‘thesis.log’ and ‘thesis.aux’.  Here the job name is ‘thesis’.

   In general, LaTeX is invoked as ‘LATEX-ENGINE OPTIONS ARGUMENT’,
where LATEX-ENGINE is ‘pdflatex’, ‘lualatex’, etc. (*note TeX
engines::).  If ARGUMENT does not start with a backslash, as is the case
above with ‘thesis’, then TeX considers it to be the name of the file to
input as the main document.  This file is referred to as the “root file”
(*note Splitting the input::, and *note \input::).  The name of that
root file, without the ‘.tex’ extension if any, is the jobname.  If
ARGUMENT does start with a backslash, or if TeX is in interactive mode,
then it waits for the first ‘\input’ command, and the jobname is the
argument to ‘\input’.

   There are two more possibilities for the jobname.  It can be directly
specified with the ‘-jobname’ option, as in ‘pdflatex -jobname=myname’
(*note Command line input:: for a practical example).

   The final possibility is ‘texput’, which is the final fallback
default if no other name is available to TeX.  That is, if no ‘-jobname’
option was specified, and the compilation stops before any input file is
met, then the log file will be named ‘texput.log’.

   A special case of this is that in LaTeX versions of (approximately)
2020 or later, the jobname is also ‘texput’ if the first ‘\input’ occurs
as a result of being called by either ‘\documentclass’ or
‘\RequirePackage’.  So this will produce a file named ‘texput.pdf’:

     pdflatex "\documentclass{minimal}\begin{document}Hello!\end{document}"

   However, this special case only applies to those two commands.  Thus,
with

     pdflatex "\documentclass{article}\usepackage{lipsum}\input{thesis}"

the output file is ‘lipsum.pdf’, as ‘\usepackage’ calls ‘\input’.

   Within the document, the macro ‘\jobname’ expands to the jobname.
(When you run LaTeX on a file whose name contains spaces, the string
returned by ‘\jobname’ contains matching start and end quotes.)  In the
expansion of that macro, all characters are of catcode 12 (other) except
that spaces are category 10, including letters that are normally
catcode 11.

   Because of this catcode situation, using the jobname in a conditional
can become complicated.  One solution is to use the macro ‘\IfBeginWith’
from the ‘xstring’ package in its star variant, which is insensitive to
catcode.  For example, in the following text the footnote "Including
Respublica Bananensis Francorum." is only present if the task name
starts with ‘my-doc’.

     If a democracy is just a regime where citizens vote then
     all banana republics \IfBeginWith*{\jobname}{my-doc}%
     {\footnote{Including Respublica Bananensis Francorum.}}{} are
     democracies.

   Manipulating the value of ‘\jobname’ inside of a document does not
change the name of the output file or the log file.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Recovering from errors,  Prev: Jobname,  Up: Command line interface

28.4 Recovering from errors
===========================

If LaTeX finds an error in your document then it gives you an error
message and prompts you with a question mark, ‘?’.  For instance,
running LaTeX on this file

     \newcommand{\NP}{\ensuremath{\textbf{NP}}}
     The \PN{} problem is a million dollar one.

causes it show this, and wait for input.

     ! Undefined control sequence.
     l.5 The \PN
                {} problem is a million dollar one.
     ?

The simplest thing is to enter ‘x’ and ‘RETURN’ and fix the typo.  You
could instead enter ‘?’ and ‘RETURN’ to see other options.

   There are two other error scenarios.  The first is that you forgot to
include the ‘\end{document}’ or misspelled it.  In this case LaTeX gives
you a ‘*’ prompt.  You can get back to the command line by typing
‘\stop’ and ‘RETURN’; this command does its best to exit LaTeX
immediately, whatever state it may be in.

   The last scenario is that you mistyped the filename.  For instance,
instead of ‘pdflatex test’ you might type ‘pdflatex tste’.

     ! I can't find file `tste'.
     <*> tste

     (Press Enter to retry, or Control-D to exit)
     Please type another input file name:

The simplest thing is to enter ‘CTRL d’ (holding the Control and d keys
down at the same time), and then retype the correct command line.

A.4 Larger ‘book’ template
==========================

This is a somewhat elaborate template for a book.  *Note book
template::, for a simpler one.

   This template uses ‘\frontmatter’, ‘\mainmatter’, and ‘\backmatter’
to control the typography of the three main areas of a book (*note
\frontmatter & \mainmatter & \backmatter::).  The book has a
bibliography and an index.

   Also notable is that it uses ‘\include’ and ‘\includeonly’ (*note
Splitting the input::).  While you are working on a chapter you can
comment out all the other chapter entries from the argument to
‘\includeonly’.  That will speed up compilation without losing any
information such as cross-references.  (Material that does not need to
come on a new page is brought in with ‘\input’ instead of ‘\include’.
You don't get the cross-reference benefit with ‘\input’.)
