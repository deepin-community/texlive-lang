README for Asymptote Overview by Jim Hefferon

Asymptote is a language for creating mathematical graphics.  This document
gives you a quick overview, illustrating with a few familiar Calculus
examples.  You can work through it in a couple of hours to decide if
you want to have a try at a few of your own and then maybe start in with a
tutorial or the official reference.
