\documentclass{article}

\graphicspath{ {asy/} }  % Path to poster graphic; dirs in curly braces,  trailing slash  
\usepackage{asymptote}

% For non-manipulable 3D figures, just compile with "asy vectors" and
% include the PDF output as with 2D figures.
% For manipulable 3D figures: 
% (1) Compile the .asy file with "asy -inlineimage vectors". 
% It outputs a number of files, including .tex and .pre files, 
% and the .pdf "poster" that you click on to start the manipulation. 
% (2) Include the .pre line here along with one of the lines in center below
\input asy/vectors.pre

\begin{document}
Include the output graphic directly in the text body.
\begin{center}
%   \asyinclude{asy/vectors.asy}  
  \input asy/vectors.tex %
\end{center}  
If you use the commented-out way then run 
\texttt{asy -inlineimage <latex-fn>-1}
between a pair of \LaTeX{} runs of this file.
\end{document}
