Table material is made to float with the envronment:
\begin{quote}
  \verb=\begin{table}= \emph{head\_text\quad table\quad foot\_text\quad}
  \verb=\end{table}
\end{quote}
where \emph{table} stands for the entire table as defined in the 
\texttt{tabular} environment, \emph{head\_text} for whatever text appears
above the table, and \emph{foot\_text} for that below. Width, spacing,
and positioning of the texts relative to the table are all matters for the
user to arrange.
