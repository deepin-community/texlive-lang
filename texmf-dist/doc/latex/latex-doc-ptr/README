latex-doc-ptr

  This is intended as the document that comes up when a person runs 
'texdoc latex'.  The idea is that an exhaustive reference for LaTeX
is not what the overwhelming majority of users would find useful at
that point.  Instead, it gives a selection of resources, for a
variety of users.
