## Author's Note

My general intention in writing this tutorial was to include only the things that would be most useful for undergraduate students whose studies involve lots of mathematics and who may want to start writing their assignments in LaTeX. I did not intend for it to be packed with every piece of information one could possibly find; that's what books and the internet are for. Everything in *LaTeX for Undergraduates* and the `alounsburymacros` package is either something I used in my four years as an undergraduate student or something useful that I found while writing this and thought was worth including.
