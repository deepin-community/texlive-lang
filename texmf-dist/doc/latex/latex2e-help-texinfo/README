README for latex2e.texi, aka the latex2e-help-texinfo package.
This README file originally written 2008, Karl Berry.

This project is an attempt to write a reference manual for core LaTeX.
It is unofficial and the LaTeX Project members have not reviewed it.

We offer two web versions of this manual.  We have a version that is
split into separate web pages for each section or subsection.
  https://latexref.xyz/
We also have a single-page version. 
  http://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html

More informaion is at https://latexref.xyz/dev/, including links to the
current output in various formats, sources, mailing lists, and other
infrastructure. The project page for repository access, etc., is 
https://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/projects/latexrefman/.

Help is most definitely wanted.  (Search for "xx" in the source for just
a few deficiencies.  More ideas at https://latexref.xyz/dev/writing.html.)
Please email any bug reports, new material, general discussion, whatever,
to latexrefman@tug.org (see https://lists.tug.org/latexrefman for archives
and subscription via the web).

License: the manual is released under the old-style GNU documentation
license, because that is what the original authors used. (It was the
recommended license at the time.) This README file and other
supplementary files are public domain.
