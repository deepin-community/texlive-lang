How to typeset this guide
-------------------------

Please note that some LaTeX packages may be missing from your default
configuration. To include them, do the following (Linux/Unix):

- download the missing package from the CTAN. For instance, let's
suppose you don't have slashbox.sty; you'll get it from
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/slashbox

- run these commands:

    $ mkdir -p ~/texmf/tex/latex/slashbox
    $ cp slashbox.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/slashbox

- repeat the above steps for each missing package; when you're done,
type:

    $ texhash ~/texmf

- typeset the guide with pdflatex:

$ latexmk -pdf latex4wp

or run 'pdflatex' three times.

Enjoy!
