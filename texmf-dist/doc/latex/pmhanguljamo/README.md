## About

This LaTeX package provides Hangul *transliteration* input method, which allows to typeset Korean Letters (Hangul) with the help of proper fonts. The name is from “Poor man’s Hangul Jamo Input Method.” 

It is mainly for the people who have a system without Korean keyboard IM, but want to typeset Hangul in their document. Not only modern Hangul, but so-colled “Old Hangul” characters that uses the lost letters can also be typeset.

XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX is recommended. And the legacy pdfTeX is not supported.

In version 0.3, it provides two kinds of transliteration rules. The default way is this package's unique method. The alternative one is a more familiar *Korean Romanization Rule*. With the latter only Modern Hangul can be typeset.

In version 0.5, it is possible to specify proper font for typesetting Jamo Hangul. And in version 0.5.1, a few bugs were fixed and providing font feature to the very font was enabled.

The current version is 0.5.2.
