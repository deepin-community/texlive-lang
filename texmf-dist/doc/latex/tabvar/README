Installation: this bundle is included in most TeX distributions, but
if you need to install it by yourself, a TDS compliant zip archive is
provided (tabvar.tds.zip).  Just download that file, and unpack it in
your TDS directory (~/texmf for Unix-like systems).
You have got everything in place including documentation and sources,
the only remaining thing to do is to type the command

in a Terminal window in order to make the PostScript arrows available.
